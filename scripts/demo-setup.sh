Session "$SESSION" is up. The storyboard is docs/demo.md; the short version:

Beat 1 — it survives (record real pixels; asciinema cannot carry kitty
graphics). In a graphics-capable terminal (Ghostty, kitty, WezTerm),
start your screen recorder, then:

    $PHUX attach $SESSION
    bash docs/assets/payload.sh     # truecolor, styles, OSC 8, an image
    Ctrl-A d                        # detach; the server keeps the pane
    $PHUX attach $SESSION           # reattach — everything is still there

Beat 2 — an agent could have done that. From a second terminal, no TTY:

    $PHUX run $SESSION "cargo --version"
    $PHUX watch --json $SESSION     # live events; Ctrl-C to cut

Afterwards:

    $PHUX kill $SESSION
EOF
