# phux-vt-web

A thin, safe **Rust driver for ghostty's `libghostty-vt` terminal engine,
compiled to WebAssembly** (`ghostty-vt.wasm`).

It does one thing: load the engine module and give Rust a small, safe surface
over its C ABI — make a terminal, write VT bytes into it, read the styled grid
(cells + fg/bg + cursor) back out. No networking, no protocol, no DOM. It is the
engine half of the [phux](https://github.com/phall1/phux) browser client; the
client half is [`phux-web`](../phux-web).

## Why

A terminal "screen" is produced by a **VT engine** — the thing that turns raw
bytes like `\033[1;32mhi` into "green bold `hi`." Rather than reimplement one in
JS (xterm.js-style), phux runs **ghostty's actual engine** in the browser, so
every feature — truecolor, OSC 8 hyperlinks, Kitty keyboard, grapheme
clustering, sixel parsing — behaves exactly as it does natively, for free.

The engine ships as a **self-contained** wasm module: its only import is
`env.log`, and it bundles its own allocator. So this crate loads it through the
plain `WebAssembly` JS API and drives its C ABI — **no Zig is linked into the
Rust binary** (that would mean sharing one wasm linear memory between two
toolchains; instead we run the engine as a sibling module and copy bytes across
the boundary). See phux ADR-0025.

## API

```rust
use phux_vt_web::Vt;

let vt = Vt::load().await?;          // instantiate ghostty-vt.wasm
let mut term = vt.terminal(80, 24);  // a terminal of cols × rows
term.write(b"\x1b[1;32mhello\x1b[0m\n");
let grid = term.grid();              // styled snapshot, ready to render
// grid.cells[r*cols + c] → { ch, fg, bg };  grid.cursor_col / cursor_row / cursor_visible
```

`Vt` owns the engine instance; `Terminal` is one screen on it; `Grid` is a
row-major snapshot a renderer paints. That's the whole surface.

## The engine artifact (build dependency)

This crate `include_bytes!`s `vendor/ghostty-vt.wasm` at compile time. **That
file is a gitignored build artifact** — you must generate it before building:

```sh
# from the phux repo root, inside the nix devshell (provides zig 0.15.x):
scripts/build-vt-wasm.sh        # zig build -Demit-lib-vt -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding
                                # → clients/phux-vt-web/vendor/ghostty-vt.wasm
```

`build.rs` errors with a clear message if the artifact is missing. Pin the
ghostty checkout to the same revision `libghostty-vt-sys` uses (see the native
crates' `Cargo.toml`) so the browser engine matches the native one.

| Build input | Version | For |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | 1.90 | this crate (target `wasm32-unknown-unknown`) |
| Zig | 0.15.x | building `ghostty-vt.wasm` from ghostty source |
| `wasm-bindgen` | `=0.2.121` | pinned to match the toolchain CLI |

## Tests

```sh
wasm-pack test --node     # drives the real engine; reads a truecolor cell + cursor back
```
