# Operations

**TL;DR.** How phux behaves at its operational seams: error translation at
the wire boundary, structured and redaction-safe logging, workspace continuity,
remote-listener authentication, and the exact trust boundary. phux has no
durable access audit log or runtime status command today.

---

## Error model

Library and binary boundaries use typed Rust errors appropriate to their
module; there is no single workspace-wide error enum. Errors that cross the
IPC boundary translate to `ERROR` messages with a stable `ErrorCode` and a
human-readable message. [`spec/proto.md`](./spec/proto.md) owns that wire shape
and the code catalog.

## Logging and observability

Logs are both an operator surface and a leak surface; [ADR-0028](../ADR/0028-runtime-log-control.md) owns that decision and its slicing, and this section is the home for the facts.

`tracing` is the structured logging substrate, bootstrapped in `phux_server::telemetry`. Two entry points share one layer builder:

- **Server / foreground** (`phux server`, one-shot control verbs, any `--json` path) — `telemetry::init()`. Always logs human-or-JSON text to **stderr**; stdout is reserved for protocol/PTY traffic.
- **Client / TUI** (`phux attach`, naked `phux`, `phux new` without `--json`) — `telemetry::init_client()`. Logs to a **file only**: the attach loop owns the alt screen, so a stray log line corrupts the display.

Both fmt layers emit span-close timing (`FmtSpan::CLOSE`), so any `#[instrument]` span reports elapsed duration at close.

### Environment knobs

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RUST_LOG` | Filter directives. Default `phux=info,warn`. |
| `PHUX_LOG=<path>` | Write logs to `<path>` via non-blocking file writer. Server tees to this file *in addition to* stderr; client writes here *instead of* its per-pid default. Parent directory created if missing. |
| `PHUX_LOG_FORMAT=text\|json` | `text` (default): human single-line layer. `json`: one JSON object per line for `jq`/`grep`. Applies to both stderr and file sinks. |

The **client default log path** (when `PHUX_LOG` is unset) is `$XDG_STATE_HOME/phux/client-<pid>.log` (falls back to `$HOME/.local/state/phux/`). The pid scope keeps concurrent clients from interleaving. Level defaults to `phux=info,warn`, so crashes and warnings are always captured without flooding the file.

The non-blocking file writer offloads I/O to a background thread; its `WorkerGuard` is held for the lifetime of `main` and flushes on exit.

### Sensitive data in logs

Log sinks are created with mode `0o600` (owner-only) on Unix so another user on a shared box cannot read them ([ADR-0028](../ADR/0028-runtime-log-control.md)). Input atoms are **self-narrating and redaction-safe**: `KeyEvent` and `PasteEvent` have hand-written `Debug` impls (and `InputEvent::narrate`) that report only structural facts — action, physical key, modifiers, payload *lengths* — and never the typed key text or pasted bytes. A `trace!(?input, …)` therefore records that a keystroke or paste happened, with its shape, without spilling the secret it carried.

### Crash capture

Panics are durable on both sides. The **client** panic hook logs the panic message plus a captured `std::backtrace::Backtrace` to its file sink *before* it restores the terminal (survives even though the default hook's stderr backtrace would vanish into the dead alt screen). The **server** panic hook logs task/actor panics with their backtrace through `tracing`, so a daemonized server's crash lands in the log file. Both honor `RUST_BACKTRACE` for trace verbosity.

### Reading a trace to localize lag

The hot paths carry `tracing` spans whose `CLOSE` event reports the span's duration (`time.busy`/`time.idle`), so a captured session shows where time went before a stall. The per-frame and per-tick spans are at **debug**, so the default `phux=info` filter leaves them off and effectively free; raise the level only while diagnosing.

```sh
PHUX_LOG=/tmp/phux.jsonl PHUX_LOG_FORMAT=json RUST_LOG=phux=debug phux ...
# headless repro that exercises the same server paths:
PHUX_LOG=/tmp/phux.jsonl PHUX_LOG_FORMAT=json RUST_LOG=phux=debug \
  cargo run -p phux-server --example e2e-repro
```

Two spans carry most of the signal. On the server, `synthesize_against_reference` (fields `changed_row_count`, `out_bytes`) is the per-tick CPU cost of diffing engine state for one consumer. On the client, `handle_server_frame` (grep `kind=terminal_output`) is the per-frame apply-and-paint cost; its children `vt_apply` (libghostty parse) and `paint_trigger` (render) let you attribute a client stall to parse versus paint by comparing their `time.busy`. Narrow a JSON capture to timed events with `jq -c 'select(.fields.message=="close")'`. Finer per-PTY-chunk and per-frame-emit detail is at **trace**; a wedged or leaked consumer shows as `consumer mailbox full` / `consumer mailbox closed` at debug.

There is no `phux server status`, Prometheus/OpenTelemetry exporter, runtime
per-target log-level control, or `phux logs` discovery verb today. Use `phux
ls --json` for the published session/pane view and the environment-controlled
tracing sinks above for diagnosis. [ADR-0028](../ADR/0028-runtime-log-control.md)
records the remaining operator surface.

## Agent-state detection

The server derives each pane's `phux.agent/v1` record on a timer
([ADR-0046](../ADR/0046-server-side-agent-state-detection.md)). What it reads,
exactly, and nothing else:

- **The pane's own PTY.** Its foreground process group id, and that process's
  `argv` (`/proc/<pid>/cmdline` on Linux, a `sysctl` on macOS; unavailable
  elsewhere, where the detector simply never identifies an agent). This is used
  only to answer "which agent binary is running here", and only for terminals
  this server owns.
- **That terminal's OSC title and its live viewport rows.** Both are already in
  the server's own engine state; the detector reads them, matches them against
  its rule manifests, and derives a state word.

Nothing leaves the process: no network call, no subprocess, no file write. Screen
content is **not** logged — the detector logs its derived state transitions at
`debug` and its rule-match bookkeeping at `trace`, never the matched text.

**Kill switch.** `PHUX_AGENT_DETECT=0` in the server's environment loads an empty
rule set, so no detector is constructed and no pane is scanned. Consumers fall
back to their pre-ADR-0046 title heuristics.

**Rule manifests.** Built-in manifests are compiled into the binary. Additional
or replacement manifests are read from `$PHUX_AGENT_RULES_DIR` (default
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/phux/agent-rules`), one TOML file per agent kind; a manifest
replaces the built-in of the same `kind`. Manifests are loaded and their patterns
compiled **once**, on first use. A manifest that fails to parse, or that carries
an invalid pattern, is logged at `warn` and **dropped whole** — never partially
applied — so a bad rule file degrades detection for that agent kind rather than
wedging a pane. Grep the log for the manifest's path to find it.

**When it is wrong.** Detection is level-triggered and fail-safe: a pane whose
screen matches no rule reads `idle`, never `blocked`, and the next tick
re-derives from scratch, so a wrong value corrects itself rather than sticking.
A stale manifest therefore shows up as agents that never leave `idle` — not as a
sidebar stuck on red.

## Workspace continuity and update survival

phux has two different continuity mechanisms. They are intentionally separate:

- **Restart restore:** `phux workspace save` writes a typed JSON archive of the
  running workspace. `phux workspace restore ARCHIVE` reads that archive and
  creates any missing session names on a running server. Each restored session
  starts a fresh PTY process: the archived `command` is used when present;
  otherwise phux starts the default shell in the archived cwd when available.
  This is a restart/recreate path, not a live handoff path.
- **Live update handoff:** `phux upgrade` is the mechanism intended to keep
  existing PTYs alive across a server binary re-exec. Its e2e drill is
  `cargo test -p phux --test upgrade_e2e -- --ignored`, which checks that a
  pane child PID and scrollback marker survive the upgrade.

The workspace archive stores sessions, windows, pane metadata, cwd, dimensions,
and split-layout shape where the server reports it. Restore currently recreates
missing **sessions and seed processes** only; it does not replay the archived
split tree into multiple live panes. Do not describe `workspace restore` as PTY
resurrection or full layout replay until a restore-side layout command exists
and has e2e coverage.

Operational smoke checks:

```sh
# Process/cwd restart restore smoke. Starts real phux servers.
cargo test -p phux --test workspace_archive_e2e \
  workspace_restore_starts_archived_command_process -- --ignored

# Save/restore session inventory smoke. Starts real phux servers.
cargo test -p phux --test workspace_archive_e2e \
  workspace_archive_saves_and_restores_sessions -- --ignored

# Live PTY handoff across server update/re-exec.
cargo test -p phux --test upgrade_e2e -- --ignored
```

## Security model and trust boundaries

**Design assumption:** This is not a security-hardened system for hostile environments. It is suitable for trusted networks and multi-user boxes where Unix permissions are enforced by the kernel.

The trust boundary is the operating system user. A phux server trusts every process running as the same UID that can connect to its Unix socket.

### Local trust model (single-machine)

The Unix socket lives in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/phux/` (typically `/run/user/$UID/` on Linux, or `/var/folders/.../T/` on macOS), created with parent directory mode `0o700` (user-only). The OS kernel enforces this boundary at the filesystem level; the socket inherits the parent directory's permissions.

**What this means:**
- Another user on the same machine MAY NOT connect to the socket (kernel-enforced).
- If the parent directory or socket permissions are misconfigured (e.g., accidentally mode `0o777`), the security boundary is breached. **Administrators MUST validate socket permissions in deployment; phux does not re-check at runtime.**
- The process file descriptor table (`/proc/<pid>/fd/<socket-fd>` on Linux) is not readable by other UIDs, so the socket endpoint cannot be enumerated across user boundaries.

### Federation trust model (v0.1+, forward-compatible)

**v0.1 (current):** Remote attach is available for single-server consumers over
WebSocket/TLS and QUIC/TLS. SSH-stdio is built (phux-v45.9): the dialing side
runs `ssh HOST phux stdio-bridge`, delegating authentication and encryption to
SSH; the remote bridge is an ordinary local UDS client on the target host.

**v0.2+ (future, wire-compatible):** Satellites are phux servers on other machines. The hub authenticates consumers and routes terminal sessions to satellite servers via the `Transport` trait ([ADR-0007](../ADR/0007-mosh-class-transport-and-satellites.md)).

Current remote transports:
- **WebSocket/TCP:** `phux server --listen HOST:PORT`; loopback can be plaintext
  for browser/dev use, while routable binds auto-provision TLS and require a
  `phux pair` bearer token.
- **QUIC/UDP:** `phux server --quic HOST:PORT`; always TLS 1.3 encrypted.
  Routable binds use the same token store and `phux pair` certificate
  fingerprint as the WebSocket path.
- **WebTransport/UDP:** `phux server --webtransport HOST:PORT` (or
  `PHUX_WT_ADDR`); HTTP/3 over QUIC, always TLS 1.3 encrypted — the browser's
  door to QUIC-class transport, dialed by `phux-web` with a WebSocket
  fallback. Routable binds require the same `phux pair` token, carried in the
  CONNECT request: `Authorization: Bearer <hex>` from native consumers, or
  `?token=<hex>` on the session URL from browsers (the JS `WebTransport` API
  cannot set headers); a missing or invalid token is refused with HTTP 403
  before the session exists. Shares the persisted certificate and token store
  with the WebSocket and QUIC paths.
- **SSH-stdio:** `ssh HOST phux stdio-bridge` splices the wire into the
  server's Unix socket on HOST. Reuses established SSH auth (the hub dials
  with `BatchMode=yes`, so key material must work non-interactively);
  inherits SSH's trust model plus the UDS's owner-only local boundary. No
  bearer token or certificate pin on this transport (ADR-0038 addendum).

### Remote consumer trust model (opt-in)

A remote consumer (the native mobile app) can attach over the network without
an SSH tunnel, behind TLS plus a bearer pairing token
([ADR-0031](../ADR/0031-remote-consumer-auth-and-encryption.md)). This is the
nearer-term, single-server path, distinct from the federation hub above.

The bind address is the toggle, so there is no remote-mode setup friction. For
TCP/WebSocket, set it either with `phux server --listen HOST:PORT` or the
`PHUX_WS_ADDR` environment variable (the flag wins when both are present):

- **Loopback address → plaintext, unauthenticated.** The historical
  browser-client dev path; zero config.
- **Routable address → TLS + token, auto-provisioned.** Binding off-loopback is
  treated as exposing the server: phux generates and persists a self-signed
  certificate (under the state dir) if none is configured, and reads the default
  token store. It terminates TLS and requires an `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  in the WebSocket upgrade; a missing or unrecognized token is refused with HTTP
  401 before any phux frame is read. Plaintext never reaches a routable address.
  Tokens are minted with `phux pair`, which prints the token once alongside the
  certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint to pin out-of-band. Pair before starting a
  network listener: the server loads the token store at startup. Adding or
  deleting a token takes effect after the server restarts.

Native clients can use the same TCP fallback with:

```sh
phux attach --ws wss://HOST:PORT --token HEX --cert-fingerprint FP
```

For UDP/QUIC, set `phux server --quic HOST:PORT` or `PHUX_QUIC_ADDR` and attach
with:

```sh
phux attach --quic HOST:PORT --token HEX --cert-fingerprint FP
```

Use WebSocket/TCP when UDP is blocked by a network or firewall; use QUIC when
roaming/migration behavior matters and UDP is available.

Remote attach has protocol coverage and manual smoke coverage, but it is not a
workspace-restore mechanism. A remote WebSocket or QUIC client attaches to the
server state that exists on that server. It does not move PTYs between hosts,
and it does not replay a saved archive on the remote side by itself. Validate a
remote deployment with a loopback-secure smoke before advertising it:

```sh
# Before starting the server, mint a token and record its fingerprint:
phux pair

# Terminal 1:
PHUX_WS_SECURE=1 phux server --listen 127.0.0.1:8787

# Terminal 2:
phux attach --ws wss://127.0.0.1:8787 --token HEX --cert-fingerprint FP
```

For QUIC, use the same token/fingerprint pair with `phux server --quic
127.0.0.1:8788` and `phux attach --quic 127.0.0.1:8788 ...`.

`PHUX_WS_SECURE=1` forces the secure path on a loopback address (to exercise the
remote path locally); `PHUX_WS_TLS_CERT` + `PHUX_WS_TLS_KEY` substitute an
operator-supplied certificate for the auto-generated one; `PHUX_WS_TOKENS`
overrides the token-store path.

**What this means:**
- The trust boundary widens past the OS user: an authenticated network peer is a
  first-class consumer whose proof is a bearer token over TLS. This is a larger
  attack surface than local UDS. A routable `--listen` address engages TLS and
  token auth automatically; `PHUX_WS_SECURE=1` only forces that path on loopback.
- The token is a bearer credential — anyone holding it is the device until the
  token is revoked. The store is owner-only (`0o600`); the comparison is
  constant-time; tokens are 256-bit from the OS CSPRNG. A client certificate
  (mutual TLS) is the stronger v0.2 hardening recorded in ADR-0031.
- Certificate lifecycle is an operator responsibility, like socket permissions.
  With a self-signed certificate, verifying the `phux pair` fingerprint on the
  device's first connect is what closes the trust-on-first-use MITM window.

### Connecting from another network (overlay reachability)

The remote-consumer path above authenticates and encrypts the link, but it
still needs the client to **reach** the server's address. A self-hosted server
behind NAT/CGNAT/a firewall has no inbound-reachable address, so a phone on
cellular or another Wi-Fi cannot dial it directly — same-network or a VPN is
required.

The sanctioned answer for self-hosters is a **WireGuard-class overlay network**,
which gives the client a routable address that works through NAT
([ADR-0037](../ADR/0037-overlay-network-reachability.md)). phux needs no special
configuration for this: an overlay is an L3 substrate, and phux dials the overlay
address exactly as it dials a LAN address. Because an overlay IP is non-loopback,
the secure path (TLS + token) engages automatically; cert pinning is on the
fingerprint, not the hostname, so MagicDNS-style names work unchanged.

phux is **overlay-agnostic** — pick what fits your trust model:

- **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)** — the frictionless on-ramp. Install on
  the server host and the client; attach to the server's `100.x` IP or its
  MagicDNS `*.ts.net` name.
- **[Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale)** — a self-hostable,
  fully-OSS Tailscale control plane, for operators who will not depend on a
  third-party coordinator.
- **Raw [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com), [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula),
  or [Netbird](https://netbird.io)** — for hand-rolled overlays. All behave
  identically to phux; it only ever sees an IP.

For step-by-step Tailscale, Headscale, and raw WireGuard walkthroughs, see
[Remote access](./remote-access.md).

```sh
# Before starting the server:
phux pair                            # token + fingerprint, plus the detected overlay address

# Server, reachable on its overlay address:
phux server --listen 0.0.0.0:8787   # binds all interfaces, including the overlay

# Client, from anywhere on the overlay:
phux attach --ws wss://<overlay-host>:8787 --token HEX --cert-fingerprint FP
```

Overlay-address detection in `phux pair` is best-effort (the `tailscale` CLI
when present, else a CGNAT route heuristic); raw-WireGuard operators on
private ranges find the address with their usual tooling. `PHUX_TAILSCALE`
substitutes the CLI that `phux pair` runs (default: `tailscale` on PATH),
mirroring `PHUX_SSH` for the hub dialer.

Hosted relays, rendezvous servers, and NAT hole-punching that would remove the
both-ends-install requirement are deliberately out of scope for the self-host
repo; see ADR-0037.

### Output mode for remote consumers

A remote phone link is high-latency and may be lossy. A remote consumer SHOULD
request `OutputMode::StateSync` ([ADR-0018](../ADR/0018-lazy-state-synchronization.md))
at HELLO rather than the default `OutputMode::Raw`: StateSync ships the minimum
VT to move the consumer's last-acked state to canonical per tick, coalescing
floods and pacing per-consumer RTT. Raw stays the default for local interactive
peers, where byte-faithful pass-through is lowest-latency on a fast link.

### Known limitations

- **Local transports are plaintext:** UDS and explicit loopback WebSocket carry
  plaintext. UDS relies on filesystem permissions; loopback WS is a development
  path. Routable WSS and QUIC listeners use TLS.
- **Scrollback unencrypted:** Terminal history is stored in the libghostty grid in RAM, unencrypted. A memory dump can recover it.
- **Encryption belongs to the transport:** phux frames have no independent
  per-command encryption. WSS and QUIC protect the complete stream with TLS.
- **No audit logging:** phux does not log which user accessed which terminal or when. Can be added as future hooks.
- **SSH is the trust boundary for remote attach (v0.1):** phux does not perform additional authentication over SSH; it delegates entirely to SSH key management and host verification.

### What you DO get

- **Kernel-enforced permission boundary:** On Linux and macOS, the OS prevents other users from connecting to your socket.
- **No privilege escalation surface:** The server runs as your user (not setuid/setgid). A compromised terminal cannot elevate to other UIDs.
- **No eval RPC:** phux does not evaluate source text inside the server, but an
  authenticated consumer can spawn commands and drive shells with the server
  user's authority. Treat a remote token as command-execution access.
- **Process isolation via OS:** Each terminal's PTY is managed by the kernel; one terminal's PTY cannot directly access another terminal's memory or file descriptors.
