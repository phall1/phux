# The phux reference TUI

**TL;DR.** The reference TUI's consumer-facing product surface:
subcommands, keybinds, status bar, layout, hooks, recording. The TUI is
the wedge — the daily-driver adoption surface — and its differentiator is
the wire: attach/detach, remoting, and a human and their agents sharing
the same live terminals. It is held a pure consumer with no protocol
privilege by [ADR-0017](../../ADR/0017-tui-not-protocol-privileged.md).
What's normative lives in [`../spec/`](../spec/); this file is the
human-facing reference for the tmux-shaped consumer that ships in tree.

---

## 0. What this is, what this isn't

This document is the **reference TUI consumer's product surface**: the
things a tmux-shaped phux user sees and configures — how a user invokes
the TUI, configures it, binds keys, reads its status output, and extends
it. Where this document conflicts with the normative wire spec under
[`../spec/`](../spec/), the spec wins; file an issue.

### 0.1 The TUI is the wedge, not a second local multiplexer

The reference TUI is worth heavy product investment because it is the
adoption surface that bootstraps a population of terminals-on-the-wire
([ADR-0030](../../ADR/0030-engine-delegated-wire-and-projection-consumers.md)
§6). What distinguishes it from a local multiplexer is not local splits —
those are table stakes — but the wire underneath: a phux session lives on
the server, so a client can **attach and detach** without killing it,
**remote** over a transport, and let a **human and their agents share the
same live terminals** ([`agents.md`](./agents.md) drives those terminals
side-effect-free while a human watches). The local-tiling features in this
doc are the familiar shape that gets a tmux user in the door; the wire is
why they stay.

Investing in the TUI as a product and holding it as a pure consumer are
not in tension. The constraint that keeps the wedge from corrupting the
platform is [ADR-0017](../../ADR/0017-tui-not-protocol-privileged.md): the
TUI gets no protocol-level standing, and its needs land as L3 conventions
and client logic, never as new wire surface. Other consumers — the
[agent CLI](./agents.md), the [MCP adapter](./mcp.md), the
[browser client](./web.md), a future native GUI — are peers, each its own
file under [`docs/consumers/`](./).

For the long arc, read [`../vision.md`](../vision.md). For the wire
protocol, see [`../spec/`](../spec/). For internal structure, see
[`../architecture/`](../architecture/). This document is everything
between.

### 0.2 TUI vocabulary maps to the substrate

The user-facing vocabulary is tmux's. Under the hood, each TUI concept
maps to substrate concepts. Following
[ADR-0030](../../ADR/0030-engine-delegated-wire-and-projection-consumers.md),
there is **no L2 collection tier**: a session is L3 grouping metadata plus
client logic, not a wire-level lifecycle entity.

| TUI vocabulary | Substrate mapping |
|---|---|
| Session | L3 metadata grouping a set of `TerminalId`s under a well-known key plus client logic; named via the `phux.session.name/v1` key. Not an L2 tier. Atomic teardown rides the single `KILL_TERMINALS` L1 op. |
| Window | TUI convention. An entry in a layout-tree blob stored in L3 metadata, keyed by `phux.tui.layout/v1` for the session's terminals. |
| Pane | L1 Terminal (`TerminalId`) referenced from a leaf of the TUI's layout tree. |
| Layout (split tree) | TUI convention. The shape stored in the L3 metadata blob above. ADR-0012's "binary split, not n-ary" still governs *this tree*; it is not a wire concept. |
| Active pane / window focus | TUI convention. Per-client, persisted in TUI metadata if the client wants it to come back on reattach. |
| Status bar / hooks / keybindings | TUI-local. Not on the wire. |
| Mouse routing (click-to-focus, drag-to-resize) | TUI-local. The wire carries `INPUT_MOUSE`; what to do with it is the TUI's call. |

A consumer that doesn't want this vocabulary doesn't have to learn it;
the substrate doesn't carry it. `GroupId` survives only as a
documented opaque grouping key, not a lifecycle tier — its full removal is
tracked by bead phux-0bmc.

## 1. CLI surface

phux is a single binary with subcommands. The naked invocation —
`phux` — is the common case: attach to the user's server, lazily
spawning it if it isn't running. With no arguments it auto-spawns a server
if the socket is missing, then attaches via `AttachTarget::Last` with a
fallback to `AttachTarget::ByName("default")` when the server has no
prior-attach memory. Auto-spawn (the client forks itself as `phux server`
if the socket is missing, polls 25 ms / 2 s) covers both the naked and the
explicit-attach paths.

### 1.1 The shipped verbs

These are the main interactive and control entrypoints. `phux --help` is the
complete generated inventory, including supervision, upgrade, tags, pairing,
agents, and workspace commands:

```
phux                          # attach to default session, autostart server
phux attach [SESSION]         # attach explicitly; session optional (alias: a)
phux attach --quic HOST:PORT [--cert-fingerprint FP] [--token HEX]
                              # attach to a remote server over QUIC (TLS 1.3).
                              # loopback trusts the dev cert; routable hosts
                              # require --cert-fingerprint (from `phux pair`)
phux attach --ws ws://127.0.0.1:8787
                              # attach over the WebSocket/TCP fallback locally
phux attach --ws wss://HOST:PORT --cert-fingerprint FP --token HEX
                              # attach over TLS WebSocket when UDP/QUIC is blocked
phux server [--session N] [--listen HOST:PORT] [--quic HOST:PORT] [--hub]
                              # run server in foreground (incl. for SSH; no --stdio yet)
                              # --listen also accepts WebSocket clients (= PHUX_WS_ADDR)
                              # --quic also accepts QUIC clients (= PHUX_QUIC_ADDR)
                              # --hub validates [[satellites]] into the runtime
                              # satellite table at startup (no dialing/routing yet)
phux new [-s NAME] [-c CWD] [--] [COMMAND...]
                              # create a session
phux ls                       # list sessions (alias: list)
phux kill TARGET              # kill session/window/pane by selector
phux rename SESSION NEW-NAME  # rename a session
phux snapshot [TARGET]        # dump pane grid (for piping/scripting)
phux snapshot --rendered      # dump the client's composited multi-pane view
phux send-keys TARGET KEYS... # send keys to a pane (scripting)
phux run TARGET CMD...        # run a command in a pane, capture $?
phux wait [TARGET]            # poll a pane until a condition holds
phux watch [TARGET]           # stream a pane's live events
phux ask TARGET QUESTION      # report an agent ask event for a pane
phux config <init|path|show>  # scaffold + inspect config
phux config plugins [--json]  # compatibility alias: inspect plugin manifests
phux config agents [--json]   # inspect configured plugin agent states
phux config run PLUGIN ACTION # execute a configured plugin action
phux plugin <COMMAND>         # install/update/link/list/toggle/unlink/validate plugins
phux satellite <COMMAND>      # add/list/remove federation satellites
phux --version                # print version
phux help [COMMAND]
```

The agent-facing verbs — `ls`, `snapshot`, `send-keys`, `run`, `wait`,
`watch`, `ask` (and `new`'s create-only `--json` mode) — have their JSON
contracts and exit-code semantics documented in [`agents.md`](./agents.md);
this file does not restate them.

### 1.2 new / kill / rename ride the wire mechanism; UX is unchanged

`new`, `kill`, and `rename` no longer ride dedicated session/collection
L1 verbs. Per
[ADR-0030](../../ADR/0030-engine-delegated-wire-and-projection-consumers.md)
they decompose onto the substrate, with no change to what the user types:

- **`new`** is `SPAWN_TERMINAL` plus an L3 metadata write
  (`phux.session.create/v1`, read back via `phux.session.created/v1`).
- **`rename`** is an L3 metadata SET on `phux.session.name/v1`.
- **`kill`** of a whole group is the atomic `KILL_TERMINALS { ids }` L1
  op (tag `0x09`), applied all-or-nothing under the server's single lock
  so no observer sees a partial teardown.

The command words, flags, and output are exactly as before; only the
wire path beneath them changed.

### 1.3 No CLI verbs for split/detach — they are interactive actions

Split-pane (`C-a |`) and detach (`C-a d`) **are implemented** as
interactive TUI keybinding actions (§5.4). There are deliberately no
headless `phux split` / `phux detach` CLI verbs: splitting a pane and
detaching from a session are interactive view actions performed against
a live attached TUI, not headless operations a script invokes. This is a
settled design decision, not pending work — a headless `phux split`/`phux
detach` would have no attached viewport to act on.

> **Status (design intent, not shipped):** `windows`, `panes`, and
> `messages` are listed in earlier drafts as future read verbs; none
> ships today. `config` ships `init` / `path` / `show` / `reload` (§4.3);
> `config edit` is design intent.

**The target convention.** The verbs that address an existing pane —
`kill`, `snapshot`, `send-keys`, `run`, `wait`, `ask` — take the selector as a
**positional** `TARGET` (omitted on `snapshot`/`wait` to mean the
focused/last session). `attach` likewise takes its `[SESSION]` name
positionally. `new` is the exception: because its trailing `[COMMAND...]`
is a positional var-arg, the *new* session's name is the `-s`/`--session`
flag instead, keeping the command words unambiguous. So: positional target
to act on something that exists; `-s` to name something you are creating.

**Flags before the target.** `send-keys`, `run`, `wait`, and `ask` take a
trailing var-arg (the keys / command / nothing), so every flag —
`--json`, `--timeout`, `--until`, `--idle`, `--socket` — MUST precede the
positional `TARGET`; anything after it is swallowed into the trailing
words. Each command's `--help` calls this out.

**Output hygiene (for scripts and agents).** One-shot verbs print no
banner and keep stdout clean. With `--json`, stdout carries ONLY the JSON
document; diagnostics go to stderr with a nonzero exit, never interleaved
into the JSON. The verbs that emit `--json` are `ls`, `snapshot`, `wait`,
`run`, `new`, `config show`, `config plugins`, `config agents`, `config run`,
`plugin`, and `satellite`. Their
per-verb JSON shapes and the stable exit-code semantics are owned by
[`agents.md`](./agents.md) §3–§4 — this file does not restate them.

## 2. The user model

Three nouns. Same as tmux. Don't reinvent vocabulary that users already
know.

- **Session** — top-level container. Named. Persists across client
  disconnects. Lives until explicitly killed or until the server exits.
- **Window** — tab within a session. Numbered from 0 within its session;
  optionally named.
- **Pane** — leaf in a window's layout. One PTY, one terminal grid, one
  shell or command.

A **client** is an attached frontend (TUI or GUI). Clients are
transient; they are not part of the session model. The protocol exposes
`ClientId` only for the duration of a connection.

---

## 3. Selectors

A selector identifies a session, window, or pane. Selectors appear in
CLI arguments, keybinding actions, and hook arguments.

| Selector              | Meaning                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `.`                   | current — the client's focused pane/window/session |
| `name`                | session by name                                  |
| `name:N`              | session `name`, window index `N`                 |
| `name:N.M`            | session `name`, window `N`, pane index `M`       |
| `name:tag`            | session `name`, window whose name is `tag`       |
| `@N`                  | opaque ID (pane/window/session) — stable for the |
|                       | server's lifetime                                |
| `=`                   | last (most recently focused)                     |
| `#tag`                | every Terminal carrying L3 tag `tag`             |

The `#tag` form (ADR-0027) resolves to the **set** of Terminals tagged
`tag`, exactly as a session name resolves to many panes. Tags are L3
metadata (`phux.tags/v1`), read and written with `phux tag`:

```text
phux tag add work:1.0 build ci    # tag a pane
phux tag ls .                      # list the focused pane's tags
phux kill #build                   # kill every Terminal tagged 'build'
phux tag rm @7 ci                  # untag
```

One grammar, every command. `kill`, `snapshot`, `wait`, `send-keys`, `run`, and
`ask` all accept the same `TARGET` (phux-n95) and resolve it client-side
against a `GET_STATE` snapshot (ADR-0021) — the server never parses a
selector. A selector that names several panes (a whole session or window)
resolves to a single **selected pane**: the focused pane if it is among
the matches, else the first in snapshot order. So `phux send-keys work …`
targets the pane you are looking at in session `work`, while
`phux send-keys work:1.0 …` targets exactly window 1, pane 0. `send-keys`
and `run` route input to that resolved pane by id — no attach, no resize
(phux-3j3). Omit the target on `snapshot`/`wait` to default to the
focused/last session.

The CLI infers what kind of selector is expected from the command. When
ambiguity matters, prefer the most specific form. Example:

```sh
phux kill work:edit.2         # second pane in window "edit" of session "work"
phux send-keys @42 "ls" Enter # send to the pane with stable id 42
phux run work:1.0 "cargo test"# run in window 1, pane 0 of session "work"
phux kill =                   # kill last-focused (within whatever the command targets)
```

## 4. Configuration

### 4.0 Philosophy and the `phux config` commands

phux is **config-driven**, in the Ghostty mold
([ADR-0023](../../ADR/0023-config-ux-philosophy.md)): one TOML file is the
whole source of truth, and phux never writes settings back from running
state. There is no `set-option` verb. The defaults you don't override
ship *inside the binary* as an embedded, annotated `default.toml`; your
`config.toml` is a sparse overlay merged on top of it leaf-by-leaf. A key
you omit keeps tracking the binary's default, so a phux upgrade that
improves a default reaches you automatically — your file is overrides,
not a frozen snapshot.

A missing config file is not an error; phux runs on the embedded defaults
alone. To get a documented starting point and to inspect what's active:

```
phux config path            # print the resolved config path (no I/O)
phux config init            # scaffold a commented starter config there;
                            #   refuses to overwrite (use --force)
phux config init --distro herdr
                            # same scaffold plus one active extends line
                            #   layering a starter distribution (bundled
                            #   name or path); see docs/CONFIG.md
phux config show            # print the effective config (defaults + your
                            #   overrides) as canonical TOML
phux config show --default  # print the shipped defaults verbatim,
                            #   comments and all — the annotated source
phux config show --layers   # provenance: which layer of the extends
                            #   stack (ADR-0039) set each effective key;
                            #   arrays list each element's contributor.
                            #   --json for the stable document
                            #   (schema_version 1)
phux config plugins --json  # print configured plugin manifests as JSON
phux config agents --json   # print configured plugin agent states as JSON
phux config reload          # validate, then apply the config to running
                            #   clients in place (see 4.3)
phux plugin list --json     # inspect the plugin registry
phux plugin validate        # validate every configured plugin manifest
```

`phux config init` writes the shipped defaults *with every line commented
out*: the file documents every option next to its real default value, yet
imposes no overrides until you uncomment a line. That is what keeps the
binary's defaults authoritative — uncommenting is the only way the file
changes behavior. The `--distro` flavor adds exactly one live statement —
an `extends` line layering a curated starter distribution (ADR-0039)
between the defaults and your file; the distro layer is referenced, never
copied, so its updates keep reaching you. Distribution mechanics and the
bundled `herdr` starter are documented in
[docs/CONFIG.md](../CONFIG.md#starter-distributions-config-init---distro). `config show` renders the merged TOML *table*, so it
answers "what is my effective config" rather than reproducing your file's
comments or key order; `cat` the file for the latter.

For testing config changes inside a checkout without touching your real
`~/.config/phux`, `just scaffold-config` drops a starter into a
worktree-local `./.phux-xdg` (gitignored); point `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` at it
to exercise the result.

### 4.0.1 First-run onboarding hint

On attach, when **nothing exists at the resolved config path** (the path
`phux config path` prints), the TUI shows a small dismissible overlay
pointing at `phux config init` and the `C-a ?` help binding — the two
affordances that answer "now what?" on a fresh install. The exact rules:

* **Decided once per `phux attach` invocation**, by a single existence
  check at attach time. Switching sessions inside the same invocation
  does not re-show it; creating a config mid-attach does not retract an
  already-shown hint (the next attach simply won't show one).
* **Any key dismisses it** for the rest of that invocation. The
  keystroke is consumed by the overlay (like every modal), so the hint
  costs exactly one keystroke.
* **It never appears when anything exists at the config path** — a
  config file (even one that fails to parse) or a stray directory.
  Presence, not validity, is the test: an unparsable config means you
  have already found the config system, and `phux config init` refuses
  to overwrite, so the hint's advice would be wrong there. When the
  check itself is undetermined (e.g. a permission error on the config
  directory), the hint stays suppressed.
* **Nothing is persisted.** There is no "seen" flag or state file: while
  no config exists, every attach shows the hint once; running
  `phux config init` (or writing any config file) silences it
  permanently.

The hint hardcodes `C-a ?` deliberately — it only ever shows when no
config file exists, which is exactly when the embedded defaults (prefix
`C-a`, `?` = `show-help`, section 5.3) are guaranteed to be active.

### 4.1 File location

Config is read from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/phux/config.toml` (or
`~/.config/phux/config.toml`). Set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to isolate configuration
for a test or alternate environment; there is no global config-path flag.

Runtime and persistent state are split. The Unix socket lives in the
runtime dir (where it's expected to disappear on reboot); persistent
state lives in the state dir.

```
$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/phux/phux.sock     # SOCK_STREAM, parent dir mode 0o700
                                    #   (fallback: /tmp/phux-$UID/phux.sock)

$XDG_STATE_HOME/phux/
├── client-<pid>.log                # default interactive-client log
├── remote-cert.pem                 # auto-provisioned remote certificate
├── remote-key.pem                  # owner-only private key
└── remote-tokens                   # owner-only pairing tokens
```

These files are real today. A server PID file, rotated server-log directory,
and per-terminal PTY journal remain design intent; workspace archives are
written only when requested with `phux workspace save`.

### 4.2 Format

Config is **TOML**. The config tree is shallow, so TOML's idioms
(`[table]`, `[[array.of.tables]]`, inline tables for parameterized values)
cover it without deep nesting.

A minimal config:

```toml
[defaults]
shell                 = "/bin/zsh"
history-limit         = 50000
refresh-rate          = 60
# Sane-default spawn knobs (phux-4li.1):
cwd-inheritance       = "inherit-focused"
session-name-template = "default"
window-size           = "smallest"   # geometry policy for shared Terminals (ADR-0027)
# spawn-on-attach     = "/usr/bin/some-launcher"  # default: defaults.shell

[keybindings]
prefix = "C-a"

# Bindings under the prefix.
# An action is either a bare string (no parameters) or an inline
# table whose `action` field names the action and remaining fields
# pass parameters.
[keybindings.prefix-table]
'"'        = { action = "split-pane", direction = "horizontal" }
"%"        = { action = "split-pane", direction = "vertical" }
"x"        = "kill-pane"
"c"        = "new-window"
"n"        = "next-window"
"h"        = { action = "focus-direction", direction = "left" }
"j"        = { action = "focus-direction", direction = "down" }
"k"        = { action = "focus-direction", direction = "up" }
"l"        = { action = "focus-direction", direction = "right" }
"w"        = "window-picker"
"s"        = "session-picker"
"d"        = "detach"
","        = "rename-window"

# Global table: bindings that fire without a prefix.
# Empty by default; opt in to hyper/super combos if your outer
# terminal forwards them.
[keybindings.global]
# "M-Enter" = "detach"

[status]
left   = [{ kind = "windows" }]
center = [{ kind = "help-hints" }]
right  = ["session-name", { kind = "time", format = " %H:%M" }]

[[plugins]]
manifest = "/path/to/plugin/phux-plugin.toml"

[[satellites]]

```

**Spawn defaults under `[defaults]`** shape what happens when a new pane
or session comes into being:

- **`cwd-inheritance`** (string enum, default `"inherit-focused"`)
  controls how a freshly-spawned pane picks its working directory when a
  `SPAWN_TERMINAL` leaves `cwd` unset (an explicit `cwd` always wins).
  Values: `"inherit-focused"` (match the focused pane's CWD — tmux's
  default), `"home"` (always `$HOME`), `"session-root"` (the directory
  the session was created in), `"last-cwd-per-window"` (remember per
  window). `inherit-focused` and `home` are wired server-side
  (phux-cs6): `inherit-focused` reads the focused pane's *live* PTY
  working directory via a kernel query (`/proc/<pid>/cwd` on Linux,
  `proc_pidinfo` on macOS), so it tracks `cd` without any shell OSC 7
  setup. `session-root` and `last-cwd-per-window` are accepted but not
  yet resolved server-side (they fall back to no override); completing
  them is a phux-cs6 follow-up.
- **`spawn-on-attach`** (string, default unset) is the command `phux`
  spawns when it auto-creates a session on attach. Unset ⇒ honor
  `defaults.shell` (which honors `$SHELL`).
- **`session-name-template`** (string, default `"default"`) names
  auto-created sessions. Supports `${cwd-basename}` substitution against
  the client's working directory at session-create time. Unknown
  placeholders pass through verbatim.
- **`window-size`** (string enum, default `"smallest"`) picks one
  geometry when concurrent *views* of a single Terminal disagree on size.
  A Terminal is one PTY + one libghostty grid
  ([ADR-0027](../../ADR/0027-terminal-references-and-l3-links.md)), so it
  has exactly one authoritative `(cols, rows)`; mirrored panes or multiple
  attached clients share it, and a view that wants a different size
  letterboxes rather than reflowing the shared grid. The vocabulary
  mirrors tmux's `window-size`: `"smallest"` (use the smallest view —
  nothing is ever cropped; larger views letterbox), `"largest"` (use the
  largest view; smaller views may crop), `"latest"` (track the
  most-recently-resized view), `"manual"` (hold a fixed size, which
  implies a future resize verb). **Not yet wired** at the size-decision
  point: the multi-view / multi-client geometry negotiation is a follow-up
  (today the server uses last-writer-wins per the wire spec §10.5, tracked
  as phux-nk07). The key parses, validates, and defaults today so
  consumers and config can target a stable name.

**Experimental knobs** live under `[experimental]`. Today the only key
is `predictive-echo` (boolean, default `false`), which opts `phux attach`
into Mosh-class predictive local echo — a client-side guess for the next
keystroke, rendered with an underline, that is reconciled when the
server's authoritative output arrives. The TOML key is parsed by
`phux-config` and wired into the attach driver as `PredictiveConfig`.
The prediction set is the conservative mosh-proven subset
(single-grapheme inserts, end-of-line backspace, Ctrl-U at a known prompt
boundary, Enter, left/right arrows over known cells); a wrong guess is
stomped by the next authoritative frame, and repeated contradictions
trigger adaptive auto-backoff. Leave it unset or set it to `false` to keep
echo strictly authoritative; set it to `true` to opt in. Anything under
`[experimental]` may be renamed or removed without a SemVer bump.

```toml
[experimental]
predictive-echo = false
```

**Plugin manifests** live under `[[plugins]]`. This is an external package
contract, not an in-process plugin host: phux validates and inspects local
`phux-plugin.toml` manifests, executes declared actions as child processes, and
keeps terminal/session state in first-party CLI surfaces. `manifest` is an
absolute path, or a path relative to `config.toml`; `enabled` defaults to
`true`.

```toml
[[plugins]]
manifest = "./plugins/agent-tools/phux-plugin.toml"
enabled = true
```

A manifest declares package metadata and argv entrypoints:

```toml
id = "example.agent-tools"
name = "Agent Tools"
version = "0.1.0"
min_phux_version = "0.0.2"
platforms = ["linux", "macos"]

[[build]]
command = ["cargo", "build", "--release"]

[[actions]]
id = "summarize"
title = "Summarize pane"
contexts = ["pane"]
command = ["python3", "summarize.py"]
# Optional: contribute a prefix-table keybinding for this action
# (chord syntax per section 5.1, e.g. "g" or "g s"). The TUI merges it
# at attach; a chord that conflicts with the user's own [keybindings]
# (exact chord or ambiguous prefix) is dropped with a logged warning —
# user config always wins. Plugin actions also always appear in the
# command palette (section 5.5) whether or not keys is set.
keys = "g"

[[events]]
id = "idle"
title = "Pane idle"
on = "pane.idle"
command = ["sh", "-c", "printf idle"]

# Optional: contribute status-bar widgets (section 8.3). Each entry is a
# widget table (kind + kind-specific options) plus a plugin-local id and
# the bar slot ("left" | "center" | "right", default "right") to append
# to. Contributions never displace user config: the TUI appends them
# after the user's own [status] widgets, and an entry whose spec fails
# widget validation is dropped with a logged warning.
[[widgets]]
id = "battery"
slot = "right"
kind = "exec"
command = "./battery.sh"
interval = "30s"

[[agents]]
id = "codex"
label = "Codex"
state = "working"
attention = "normal"
contexts = ["workspace", "pane"]

# A pane the TUI can open as a real server-side Terminal running this
# command (section 5.5). `placement` routes where it opens: "split"
# (beside the focused pane), "tab" (a new window named after `title`),
# or "zoomed" (a split that opens filling the window). "overlay" is
# accepted by the schema but NOT hosted yet — a floating live-terminal
# surface is deferred; overlay entries are skipped with a logged
# warning and do not appear in the palette.
[[panes]]
id = "board"
title = "Agent Board"
placement = "split"
command = ["agent-board"]

[[links]]
id = "ticket"
title = "Open ticket"
contexts = ["pane"]
patterns = ["https://linear.app/*"]
command = ["agent-ticket", "{url}"]

[[workspaces]]
id = "agent-bench"
title = "Agent Bench"
contexts = ["workspace"]
agents = ["codex"]
actions = ["summarize"]
events = ["idle"]

[[workspaces.panes]]
id = "board"
pane = "board"
role = "monitor"
```

`phux plugin list --json` is the stable lifecycle inspection surface for
agents and scripts; `phux config plugins --json` remains a compatibility
read path for the same configured manifests. The plugin verbs load the
user config, resolve every configured manifest, validate ids and
non-empty command argv values, reject duplicate provider ids, and emit
`schema_version = 1` JSON documents that enumerate `actions`, `events`,
`panes`, and `links`. Invalid manifests are hard failures: they are never
silently skipped, because a future runtime host should not execute a package
the config surface could not validate.

The lifecycle verbs edit `[[plugins]]` in `config.toml` without starting
a server:

```
phux plugin install https://example.com/agent-tools.git
phux plugin install ./plugins/agent-tools       # local dir or .tar/.tar.gz/.tgz
phux plugin update [example.agent-tools]
phux plugin link ./plugins/agent-tools/phux-plugin.toml
phux plugin list --json
phux plugin disable example.agent-tools
phux plugin enable example.agent-tools
phux plugin unlink example.agent-tools
```

Manifest validation includes the `min_phux_version` gate: a manifest whose
floor is newer than the running phux is rejected at link, install, and load
time with an error naming both versions (best-effort batch consumers such
as the attach TUI skip the gated plugin with a logged warning instead of
failing wholesale).

`phux plugin install REF` fetches a whole plugin package into the managed
plugins directory — `$XDG_DATA_HOME/phux/plugins`, else
`~/.local/share/phux/plugins`. `REF` is a git URL (`https://`, `git@`,
`file://`; cloned shallow with the system `git`, `--rev BRANCH_OR_TAG` picks
a ref), a local plugin directory (copied, `.git` excluded), or a local
tarball (`.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`; extracted with the system `tar`). After
the fetch, the manifest's `[[build]]` steps for the current platform run as
child processes from the plugin root with a five-minute per-step timeout and
captured output; a failing or timed-out build aborts the install with the
step's stdout/stderr and leaves nothing linked. The validated package is
then linked into `[[plugins]]` exactly like `phux plugin link` (pass
`--disabled` to link it disabled), and its provenance — source kind, ref,
requested branch, and the resolved commit for git sources — is recorded in
the managed directory's `plugins.lock`. With `--json`, the result is a
`schema_version = 1` document under an `installed` key with `id`, `version`,
`dir`, `source`, `ref`, `branch`, `rev`, and `enabled`.

`phux plugin update [NAME]` re-fetches from the lockfile's recorded sources
(every entry, or just `NAME`), reruns the build steps, revalidates the
manifest (id changes are refused), swaps the managed copy, and records the
new resolved commit. `config.toml` is untouched because the linked manifest
path does not move. With `--json`, the result is a `schema_version = 1`
document whose `updated` array carries `id`, `version`, and `rev` per
plugin.

`phux config agents --json [--socket PATH]` projects `[[agents]]` entries
into a flat `schema_version = 2` document with `plugin_id`, `id`, `label`,
`state`, `attention`, `source`, `declared`, `runtime`, and `contexts`, so
consumers can render unknown/idle/working/blocked/done state without knowing
every plugin entrypoint. The projection is live (phux-r82.10): when a server
answers on the socket, per-pane `phux.agent/v1` records (ADR-0040) and asked
state override the declared manifest baseline; without a server the declared
values are reported with `source = "manifest"`. See
`docs/consumers/agents.md` §4.6 for the normative shape.
The config/plugin commands load the user config, resolve every configured
manifest, and validate ids and non-empty command argv values. Invalid manifests
are hard failures: they are never silently skipped, because the runtime host
should not execute a package the config surface could not validate.

`phux config run PLUGIN ACTION [--json]` executes one enabled action declared
by an inspected manifest. The runtime executes the manifest's argv directly
from the plugin root, captures stdout/stderr/exit status/duration, and kills
the child on `--timeout SECS` with wrapper exit code `125`. With `--json`, the
result is a `schema_version = 1` document containing `plugin_id`, `action_id`,
`command`, `cwd`, `outcome`, `exit_code`, `stdout`, `stderr`, and
`duration_ms`. There is no implicit shell; a plugin opts into shell behavior by
declaring `["sh", "-c", "..."]`.

`phux workspace save [--socket PATH] [--output PATH]` captures the running phux
workspace as a JSON archive. The archive records sessions, windows, pane
titles/cwds, focus, nullable commands, and layout orientation. It does not
pretend dead processes survive. `phux workspace restore ARCHIVE [--socket PATH]`
recreates missing sessions from that archive, using saved/authored cwd and
command fields where available. External packages compose this surface today:
the checked-in continuum demo autosaves/restores profile archives, and the
agent-tools demo launches and drives an `agent-bench` profile through
`phux config run`.

**Federation satellites** live under `[[satellites]]`. This is the
hub-side registry for remote phux servers; routing is a later federation
slice, but the registry name is already the host token that will appear in
`TerminalId::Satellite.host`. `endpoint` is an opaque URI string in the
registry CRUD so `ssh://devbox`, `quic://host:8788`, and `wss://host:8787`
can share one control-plane shape; `enabled` defaults to `true`.

A server started with `phux server --hub` consumes this registry: at
startup it validates every enabled entry's endpoint by scheme (`quic://`
requires an explicit `host:port`; `ssh://` is accepted but its transport
is deferred) into a runtime satellite table keyed by the registry name,
and refuses to start on a malformed enabled endpoint or a duplicate name.
Disabled entries are skipped. Dialing and routing are later federation
slices; without `--hub` the server ignores the registry entirely.

The hub authenticates to a satellite as an ordinary remote consumer
(ADR-0038): a pairing bearer token plus a TLS certificate-fingerprint pin,
both produced by running `phux pair` on the satellite host. The token is
stored **by reference** — `token-file` is an absolute path to an owner-only
file holding the hex token (the same shape as the server's token store); the
secret never appears in `config.toml` and is never printed by the lifecycle
verbs. `cert-fingerprint` is the satellite certificate's SHA-256 pin (64 hex
digits, optionally colon-separated; not a secret, stored inline).

```toml
[[satellites]]
name = "devbox"
endpoint = "quic://devbox.example:8788"
enabled = true
token-file = "/home/me/.local/state/phux/satellites/devbox.token"
cert-fingerprint = "AB:CD:..."
```

The lifecycle verbs edit `[[satellites]]` in `config.toml` without
starting a server:

```
phux satellite add devbox quic://devbox.example:8788 \
    --token-file /home/me/.local/state/phux/satellites/devbox.token \
    --cert-fingerprint AB:CD:...
phux satellite list --json
phux satellite remove devbox
```

`add` is add-or-update and replaces the whole entry, so repeat the auth
flags when re-adding a name; omitting them clears the stored auth material.

### 4.3 Reloading

Config reloads are **explicit, never automatic** (phux-foz.5). Two
surfaces trigger the same in-place reload of a running client:

- **The `reload-config` action** — a command-palette row ("Reload the
  config file"), also bindable to any chord: `R = "reload-config"` in
  `[keybindings.prefix-table]`. It ships unbound by default.
- **`phux config reload`** from any shell. The CLI validates the config
  locally first — a broken file fails right there with the parse error
  and signals nothing — then rings a reload doorbell on the server (the
  conventional L3 key `phux.config.reload/v1`, spec §3.8 of
  [`../spec/L3.md`](../spec/L3.md)) so **every** attached client re-reads
  its own config file. The config bytes never cross the wire.

A reload re-runs the full layered loader — `extends` stacks and `-append`
array merges resolve exactly as at startup — and rebuilds, atomically:
keybindings (prefix, both tables, plugin-contributed chords, the
which-key knobs), the theme, the status-bar composition, and the plugin
action rows in the palette. Failure semantics are all-or-nothing: on any
parse or validation error the client keeps the **previous** config fully
in effect and surfaces the error as a dismissable toast — never a crash,
never a half-applied mix of old and new.

Not covered by a reload (restart the client, or detach and re-attach):
pane-behavior settings read once at attach, such as `[predict]`,
`[sidebar]` geometry, and `[defaults]` (which the server owns anyway).

The file is deliberately **not watched**: watch-reload introduces a class
of "saved-mid-edit, now my keybindings are gone" papercuts, and an
explicit verb keeps a broken intermediate save inert until you ask for
it. This was the design intent recorded here before the verb shipped; it
is now the shipped behavior.

### 4.4 Theme color slots

`[theme]` is a free-form `slot = color` map. The renderer recognizes a
fixed set of named slots that color the chrome (status bar, dividers) and
overlays (help, prompt modals). Unknown slot keys are ignored; an
unparseable color keeps that slot's default. Both cases are logged at
`warn` rather than failing the load. Colors accept named values
(`"cyan"`), hex (`"#cdd6f4"`), and ANSI indices (`"12"`).

Recognized slots:

| Slot             | Default     | Used for                                  |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `accent`         | `#bef264`   | Modal titles (help / prompt border title) |
| `chord`          | `#86efac`   | Keybinding chords in the help table       |
| `action`         | terminal fg | Action labels                             |
| `dim`            | dark gray   | Footer hints, the "no bindings" notice    |
| `border`         | `#52525b`   | Modal borders                             |
| `title`          | `#bef264`   | Titles that diverge from `accent`         |
| `section_header` | yellow      | Section headings inside the help modal    |
| `error`          | red         | Error / alarm text                        |
| `surface`        | terminal bg | Modal interior background                 |
| `shadow`         | `#1c1c26`   | Modal drop shadow                         |
| `selection_fg`   | white       | Copy-mode status strip foreground         |
| `selection_bg`   | ANSI 240    | Copy-mode status strip background         |
| `attention`      | `#fbbf24`   | Agent-attention chrome (asked marker/hint) |

```toml
[theme]
accent = "#bef264"
chord = "#86efac"
border = "#52525b"
shadow = "#1c1c26"
```

## 5. Keybindings

### 5.1 The model

We support two binding tables, both always present:

- **Prefix table** (`[keybindings.prefix-table]`): bindings that fire
  after the prefix key has been pressed. This is tmux's familiar model.
- **Global table** (`[keybindings.global]`): bindings that fire any
  time. Reserved for combinations unlikely to conflict with inner
  programs — in practice, ones using `super`, `hyper`, or `meta`
  modifiers.

```toml
[keybindings]
prefix = "C-a"

[keybindings.global]
"hyper+left"  = { action = "focus-direction", direction = "left" }
"hyper+right" = { action = "focus-direction", direction = "right" }

[keybindings.prefix-table]
'"' = { action = "split-pane", direction = "horizontal" }
# ...
```

The global table is empty by default — no global bindings ship out of
the box because we cannot assume the user's outer terminal forwards
hyper/super at all. Users on Ghostty can opt in.

### 5.2 The dispatcher

Bindings invoke **actions**: named identifiers with typed parameters, not
shell strings. Every action in §5.4 routes through one `run_action`
dispatch path — the command palette and the pickers commit the *same*
`ResolvedAction` a keybinding produces, so there is a single source of
truth for what each name does (see
[`action_registry.rs`](../../crates/phux-client/src/attach/action_registry.rs)).

### 5.3 Defaults

The defaults ship with `prefix = "C-a"` (tmux-shaped). Override it in one
line of config. The shipped prefix-table bindings:

| Chord       | Action                                                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `C-a "`     | `split-pane` horizontal (stacked panes)                  |
| `C-a %`     | `split-pane` vertical (side-by-side panes)               |
| `C-a x`     | `kill-pane`                                              |
| `C-a X`     | `kill-window`                                            |
| `C-a h/j/k/l` | `focus-direction` left/down/up/right                   |
| `C-a o`     | `next-pane`                                              |
| `C-a ;`     | `previous-pane`                                          |
| `C-a z`     | `toggle-zoom`                                            |
| `C-a b`     | `toggle-sidebar`                                         |
| `C-a [`     | `copy-mode`                                              |
| `C-a c`     | `new-window`                                             |
| `C-a n/p`   | `next-window` / `previous-window`                        |
| `C-a 0`–`9` | `select-window` by index                                |
| `C-a w`     | `window-picker` (grouped: sessions, windows nested)      |
| `C-a s`     | `session-picker` (`C-a a` is a kept alias)               |
| `C-a C`     | `new-session`                                            |
| `C-a ,`     | `rename-window` (interactive prompt)                     |
| `C-a $`     | `rename-session` (interactive prompt)                    |
| `C-a H/J/K/L` | `resize-pane` left/down/up/right by 5                  |
| `C-a :`     | `command-palette`                                        |
| `C-a d`     | `detach`                                                 |
| `C-a ?`     | `show-help`                                              |

### 5.4 Action catalog

These are the actions the dispatcher actually handles today (the set is
kept in lockstep with `ACTION_NAMES` and the palette registry by a unit
test, so this table cannot silently drift):

| Action            | Parameters                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `split-pane`      | `direction` (`horizontal` \| `vertical`)    |
| `kill-pane`       |                                             |
| `new-window`      |                                             |
| `kill-window`     |                                             |
| `next-window`     |                                             |
| `previous-window` |                                             |
| `select-window`   | `index`                                     |
| `rename-window`   | `name?` (bare opens an interactive prompt)  |
| `rename-session`  | `name?` (bare opens an interactive prompt)  |
| `focus-direction` | `direction` (`left`/`right`/`up`/`down`)    |
| `resize-pane`     | `direction`, `amount`                       |
| `next-pane`       |                                             |
| `previous-pane`   |                                             |
| `toggle-zoom`     |                                             |
| `toggle-sidebar`  |                                             |
| `copy-mode`       |                                             |
| `show-help`       |                                             |
| `command-palette` | (opens the palette — §5.5)                  |
| `window-picker`   | (opens the grouped window picker — §5.5)    |
| `session-picker`  | (opens the session picker — §5.5)           |
| `new-session`     | `name?` (bare opens an interactive prompt)  |
| `switch-session`  | `name`, `window?` (re-attaches this client; `window` selects that window index after the switch — §5.5) |
| `detach`          |                                             |
| `take-input`      | seize the focused pane's input lease (ADR-0033) |
| `give-input`      | release the focused pane's input lease (ADR-0033) |
| `signal-terminal` | `signal` = `interrupt`\|`freeze`\|`resume`\|`terminate`\|`kill` (ADR-0033) |
| `set-pane`        | `mouse` = `on`\|`off`\|`toggle` — per-pane mouse opt-out (§7, ADR-0035) |
| `plugin-action`   | `plugin`, `action` — run a plugin manifest action (§5.5) |
| `plugin-pane`     | `plugin`, `pane` — open a plugin manifest pane (§5.5) |
| `reload-config`   | re-read the config and apply it in place (§4.3) |

### 5.5 Command palette and pickers

`command-palette` (`C-a :`) opens a filterable overlay listing every
action, each annotated with its currently-bound chord. Rows are grouped
under dim category headers — **Pane**, **Window**, **Session**, **View** —
when the query is empty; as you type, the headers fall away and the
matches are ranked best-first by a scored fuzzy match (contiguous runs,
word-boundary hits, and earliness all raise a row's rank), so typing `sp`
floats `split-pane` to the top. Enter commits the selected row through the
same `run_action` path a keybinding takes.

Enabled plugins' manifest `[[actions]]` appear under a trailing
**Plugin** header, one namespaced row per action
(`plugin: <plugin-name>: <action title>`). Committing one runs
`plugin-action { plugin, action }`, which executes the manifest's argv
through the same child-process runtime as `phux config run PLUGIN
ACTION` — spawned off the input loop, so a slow plugin never freezes the
TUI. A failed run (non-zero exit, timeout, or spawn error) pops a
dismissable toast showing the captured output; successes only log. A
manifest action may also declare `keys = "..."` to contribute a
prefix-table binding (see the plugin-manifest block in §4.2); user
config always wins on conflict, and the palette row shows whichever
chord actually ended up bound.

Manifest `[[panes]]` share the same **Plugin** header, one row per
hostable pane (`plugin pane: <plugin-name>: <pane title>`). Committing
one runs `plugin-pane { plugin, pane }`, which opens a real server-side
Terminal running the pane's argv through the same `SPAWN_TERMINAL` verb
`split-pane` / `new-window` use — no plugin-privileged wire surface
(ADR-0017); any consumer could do the same. The spawn's working
directory is the plugin root, and the child sees `PHUX_PLUGIN_ID`,
`PHUX_PLUGIN_PANE_ID`, and `PHUX_PLUGIN_ROOT` on top of the server's
environment (the pane counterpart of the action runtime's identity
variables). The manifest's `placement` routes where it opens:

- `split` — beside the focused pane (side-by-side), like `split-pane`.
- `tab` — a new window named after the pane's `title`.
- `zoomed` — a split whose new pane opens zoomed to fill the window;
  `toggle-zoom` reveals it tiled beside the anchor pane.
- `overlay` — **not hosted yet.** A floating live-terminal overlay is a
  larger chrome surface than the current overlay stack (modal select
  lists and prompts) supports; entries declaring it are skipped with a
  logged warning and never listed. The declaration remains valid
  manifest schema so packages can ship it ahead of the host.

Unlike `[[actions]]`, panes contribute no keybindings today; a user can
still bind one manually with a parameterized action
(`{ action = "plugin-pane", plugin = "...", pane = "..." }`).
Disabled plugins (`enabled = false`) contribute no rows.

The **session picker** (`session-picker`, `C-a s`, alias `C-a a`) lists the
server's other sessions; choosing one re-attaches this client to it
in-process (`switch-session`). A trailing "+ New session" row creates one.

The **window picker** (`window-picker`, `C-a w`) is hierarchical: every
session is a section header with its windows nested beneath it. Choosing a
window in the **current** session switches to it directly
(`select-window { index }`). Other sessions' windows are **one-step
jumps**: the client fetches each peer session's persisted layout right
after attach, so the picker lists their windows (`index:name`, pane
count) too, and choosing one commits `switch-session { name, window }` —
a single Enter re-attaches to that session and selects that window once
its layout loads. A peer session with nothing persisted yet (or one
created after this client attached) falls back to a single "switch to
this session" row; its own picker then lists its windows. The cached
foreign layouts are an attach-time snapshot: if a peer rearranged its
windows since, the jump still switches sessions and the stale window
index degrades to the session's own remembered focus (logged, no bell).

### 5.6 Which-key popup

Press the prefix and hesitate, and a small floating panel lists every
prefix-table continuation — key on the left, action on the right — built
from your live bindings (rebinds included; it is the same config snapshot
the help overlay reads). The numeric window-jump keys collapse into a
single `0-9` row.

The popup is display-only and never captures input:

- **Any key** dismisses it and executes its binding exactly as if the
  popup had never appeared. A continuation typed *before* the delay
  elapses suppresses the popup entirely — it can never eat or delay a
  chord.
- **Esc** dismisses it and cancels the pending prefix (nothing is sent to
  the pane).

Configured under `[keybindings]`:

```toml
[keybindings]
which-key = true          # default; false disables the popup
which-key-delay-ms = 600  # hesitation before it appears
```

## 6. Layout

### 6.1 The tree

A window's layout is a **binary split tree**: each interior node is a
split (horizontal or vertical) with a single `ratio` in `(0, 1)` and
exactly two children; leaves are panes. Three-way and N-way splits
are represented as nested binary splits. See
[ADR-0012](../../ADR/0012-binary-split-tree-layout.md) for the closed
decision behind this shape and the wire form in
[`../spec/L3.md`](../spec/L3.md) §3.2.

```
window: split(vertical, ratio = 0.5)
        ├── pane #0
        └── split(horizontal, ratio = 0.33)
            ├── pane #1
            └── pane #2
```

(The first ratio gives pane #0 the top half of the window; the second
gives pane #1 the left third of the bottom half.)

Tabbed layout nodes are reserved for the v0.2 wire spec (see
[`../spec/CHANGELOG.md`](../spec/CHANGELOG.md)).

The client-side rendering surface for this tree — multi-pane tiling,
borders, focus chrome, input routing to the focused pane, layout
persistence in L3 metadata under `phux.tui.layout/v1`, and the
keybind-action wiring — is settled by
[ADR-0019](../../ADR/0019-tui-multi-pane-rendering.md) and tracked under
the `phux-4li` epic.

### 6.2 Resize behavior

> **Status:** Viewport-driven reflow ships. Automatic minimum-size freezing
> now also ships (phux-foz.3): proportional re-flow and freezing are
> implemented in the layout walk itself, so paint, reflow
> (`TERMINAL_RESIZE` sizing), and mouse hit-testing all read the same frozen
> tiling.

When the client viewport (or server-aggregated viewport for multi-client
sessions) resizes, split ratios are preserved and dimensions are
redistributed proportionally. A leaf that hits its minimum size
(`min_cols = 2`, `min_rows = 1` for the inner content; chrome is per
client) freezes; remaining space redistributes among non-frozen leaves.
This mirrors tmux's resize behavior.

Below the layout's aggregate minimums (every leaf at its floor plus one
cell per interior divider) freezing disengages and pure proportional
tiling resumes: panes degrade to sub-viable rectangles rather than
disappearing, and the exact-tiling invariant (no gaps, no overlaps)
holds at every viewport size.

### 6.3 Resize commands

> **Status:** Keyboard `resize-pane` actions and mouse divider dragging ship
> (ADR-0035, phux-foz.3). `resize-pane` dispatches through the
> single-dispatch action registry, `C-a H/J/K/L` are the default bindings
> (see §5.3), the command palette offers a resize row, and drag-on-divider
> (§7) commits through the same ratio math.

`resize-pane direction=right amount=5` moves the boundary between the
focused pane and its right neighbor by 5 columns toward the right,
giving the focused pane more width. Negative amounts shrink.

Resize commands modify the relevant interior node's `ratio` (not
absolute sizes). After a subsequent window resize, the new ratio is
preserved.

A resize that would push either side of the boundary below 2 cells on
the resize axis is a bell-no-op (ADR-0019 decision 5). The gate measures
the ratio's *proportional* tiling — what the ratio asks for — not the
frozen tiling of §6.2, so a command cannot silently bank ratio behind a
frozen divider that the layout would snap to on the next viewport grow.
The new layout broadcasts to other attached clients via `SET_METADATA`
(`phux.tui.layout/v1`), like every other layout mutation.

### 6.4 Window sidebar

> **Status:** Shipped (`phux-4h5a`; herdr-shaped by `phux-p4vp`;
> interactive per `phux-fce4`).

`[sidebar]` docks a vertical window strip on the left (default) or
right edge; `toggle-sidebar` (`C-a b`) flips it at runtime. Panes tile
into the remaining content rect, so the strip never overlaps content.

Each window occupies a fixed **two-row block**, top to bottom in
`select-window` index order:

- **Name row.** The window's display label (agent record, OSC title, or
  stored name — same resolution as the status-bar tab strip), with the
  active-window marker and the §8.6 attention `!`.
- **Branch row.** The VCS branch of the window's focused pane, dim and
  nested under the label (`main`, a `wave2/...` branch, or a short
  commit hash for a detached HEAD). Blank when the pane's working
  directory is not inside a git repository.

Branch inference is **client-local and read-only**: the pane's working
directory (carried by the `ATTACHED` snapshot) is walked up to the
enclosing `.git`, worktree gitfiles (`gitdir: ...`) are resolved, and
`HEAD` is read directly — one cached file read, never a `git`
subprocess, and nothing added to the wire. The cache re-validates on a
short TTL keyed by `HEAD`'s mtime, so a `git switch` shows up on the
next chrome refresh without stat storms.

The strip's last two rows are **interactive affordances** (`phux-fce4`),
and the window blocks are click targets. Every sidebar click commits the
same `ResolvedAction` a keybinding or palette row would — one `run_action`
dispatch path, no bespoke click semantics:

| Target                      | Committed action                       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| A window block (either row) | `select-window { index }`              |
| `+ new`                     | `new-window`                           |
| `= menu`                    | `command-palette` (the session/plugin menu; `new-session` lives in its Session group) |

Pointer events over the strip never leak into pane routing: presses on
blank rows or the separator column are consumed and dropped. The same
targets stay keyboard-reachable through their actions (`C-a c`,
`C-a :`, `C-a 0`–`9`).

---

## 7. Mouse

> **Status:** Shipped (ADR-0035; per-pane opt-out in phux-npb3).
> Click-to-focus, drag-on-divider to resize, and default outer-terminal
> mouse capture are implemented. The client enables its own mouse
> tracking on attach so divider drags work without an inner program
> turning mouse mode on. Opt-outs: the global `mouse = false` config,
> and the per-pane `set-pane mouse off` action described below.

Mouse handling is enabled by default. On attach the client emits DECSET
`?1002h` (button-event tracking) + `?1006h` (SGR coordinates) for the
*outer* terminal and restores them on detach. That capture is what makes
drag-to-resize work in a plain shell: without it the client is deaf to
the pointer over a divider whenever the inner program has no mouse mode.

| Event                    | Action                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Click in pane            | Focus the pane, then forward to it    |
| Press on a divider       | Grab the boundary for a resize drag   |
| Drag a divider           | Resize the boundary (tracks pointer)  |
| Release                  | Commit the new layout (broadcast L3)  |
| Scroll wheel in pane     | Forwarded to the pane (inner program  |
|                          | sees it if it enabled mouse mode); in |
|                          | copy-mode it scrolls the focused      |
|                          | pane's local viewport                 |
| Right-click in pane      | Forwarded to the inner program        |
| Click on status bar slot | Slot-defined; default no-op           |
| Click on a sidebar row   | Select that window; `+ new` / `= menu`|
|                          | run their actions (§6.4)              |

Only divider cells change meaning. Every event inside a pane's rectangle
is forwarded to that pane with pane-local coordinates, so an inner TUI
(vim, htop) that turns mouse tracking on still receives its mouse events
— the server's per-pane encoder produces empty bytes for a pane whose
inner app has no mouse mode, so forwarding is harmless either way.

**Native selection.** Enabling outer capture suppresses the host
terminal's click-drag text selection inside the phux viewport. Hold
**Shift** to bypass application mouse reporting and use native selection
(a near-universal terminal convention; phux relies on it but does not
enforce it). A host that does not honour Shift-bypass needs
`mouse = false` for easy selection.

**Escape hatches.** `mouse = false` in `[defaults]` skips the DECSET
entirely and reverts to pass-through-only (the client only sees mouse
when an inner program enables it).

Per-pane (phux-npb3): the `set-pane` action with `mouse = "on"`,
`"off"`, or `"toggle"` (bindable, and offered by the command palette as
a toggle) opts the *focused* pane out of client mouse handling without
touching its siblings. The state is client-local and capture follows
focus: while an opted-out pane is focused the client drops its own
mouse-tracking DECSET, so the host terminal's raw handling (native
click-drag selection and friends) returns for that pane; focusing any
opted-in pane re-enables capture and drag-to-resize. While capture is
on (another pane focused), a click on the opted-out pane still focuses
it — that is the mouse path back in — but the client never synthesizes
`INPUT_MOUSE` (or the local wheel viewport scroll) for an opted-out
pane. Nothing crosses the wire; a pane's opt-out ends when it closes.

We do not ship copy-mode mouse drag selection — see §11.

## 8. Status bar

### 8.1 Architecture: widget-first from day one

The status bar is **rendered entirely client-side**. A GUI client may
ignore it and render its own chrome; the TUI client composes it from
widgets and draws it on one reserved row of the outer terminal — the
bottom row by default, or the top row with `position = "top"`.

Every slot's contents are a list of **widgets**. A widget is a typed
thing that produces styled text. The default config looks short because
a bare string is shorthand for a no-parameters widget:

```toml
[status]
left   = ["session-name"]                               # → [{ kind = "session-name" }]
center = []
right  = [{ kind = "time", format = " %H:%M" }]
position = "bottom"   # or "top"; default "bottom"
```

`position` moves the whole reserved row: with `"top"` the bar draws on
the outer terminal's first row and the panes (and sidebar strip) shift
down one row, so nothing ever underlaps the bar. Everything else —
widgets, styling, refresh — is identical in both positions.

There are three categories of widgets:

1. **Server facts.** The server already publishes session names, window
   lists, focused pane, cwd (via OSC 7), last command exit (via OSC
   133). These are widget kinds (`session-name`, `windows`, `cwd`,
   `exit`, etc.) backed by data the server pushes anyway.
2. **Client-local widgets.** Things derivable on the client without
   server help: `time`, `mode`, `key-indicator` (last key chord).
3. **`exec` widgets.** The client runs the named program on the
   configured interval and renders its stdout (parsed for SGR if it
   contains ANSI). These run per-client; a clipboard daemon, a battery
   percentage, etc.

```toml
right = [
    { kind = "exec", command = "~/.local/bin/battery", interval = "30s" },
    { kind = "text", value = " | " },
    { kind = "time", format = "%H:%M" },
]
```

### 8.2 Why widget-first

The scoping decision in `CONTRIBUTING.md` is that we will not ship a
status bar *DSL* — no `if/else` mini-language, no format-template
expression engine. The widget system gets us extensibility without
becoming a template interpreter: arbitrary logic lives in `exec`
widgets, which are real programs in real languages, supervised by the
client. The widget contract itself is small and typed.

This shape costs us almost nothing on day one (the default config is
three names in three lists), and means we never have to do an
architectural revision to grow a status bar plugin story.

### 8.3 Built-in widget kinds

| Kind            | Parameters                                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `session-name`  | `format?` (default: `"{name}"`) — **implemented**           |
| `time`          | `format` (strftime) — **implemented**                       |
| `windows`       | `active?`/`inactive?` (style tables), `separator?`, `format?` (`{index}`/`{name}`) — **implemented** |
| `help-hints`    | prefix-aware help / palette / copy affordances — **implemented** |
| `window`        | `format?` (default: `"{name}"`)                              |
| `pane`          | `format?`                                                    |
| `cwd`           | `format?`, `truncate?` (chars; keeps the path tail), `$HOME` collapses to `~` — **implemented** |
| `exit`          | `format?` (`{code}` placeholder; last command exit code, OSC 133) — **implemented** |
| `host`          | `format?`                                                    |
| `mode`          | `format?` (current input mode)                               |
| `key-indicator` | shows the last key/chord pressed; reserved for v0.2          |
| `text`          | `value` (literal styled text)                                |
| `spacer`        | flexible expanding space; no parameters                      |
| `exec`          | `command` (string via `/bin/sh -c`, or argv array), `interval?` (default `5s`, floor `1s`), `parse-ansi?` (true) — **implemented** |

Every widget kind accepts a `style` table with optional `fg`, `bg`
(color strings: names, `#rrggbb`, or palette indices), and the boolean
attributes `bold`, `dim`, `italic`, `underline`, `reverse`. The
implemented built-ins today are `session-name`, `time`, `windows`,
`help-hints`, `cwd`, `exit`, and `exec` (the others above are design
intent); `windows` takes its `active` and `inactive` segments as such
style tables. Plugin manifests can contribute additional widget entries
via `[[widgets]]` (section 7's manifest contract): each contribution is a
widget table plus a `slot`, appended after the user's own widgets, and a
contribution that fails validation is dropped with a logged warning
rather than degrading the bar.

Data feeds behind the server-fact widgets: `cwd` renders the focused
pane's live directory from `cwd_changed` events (the server queries the
PTY child's kernel cwd at OSC-133 prompt boundaries and on output
settle; the `ATTACHED` snapshot's spawn cwd seeds it), and `exit`
renders `command_finished.exit_code` (the OSC-133 `D`-mark code, so it
requires shell integration). `exec` widgets never run on the render
path: the client runs the command per `interval` as a bounded
`kill_on_drop` child process (10s hard cap) and folds captured stdout —
first line only — into a cached strip the widget renders; a failed or
timed-out run keeps the last good output.

### 8.4 Refresh and ordering

- Server-fact widgets re-render on the relevant server event (window
  rename, focus change, OSC 7/133).
- Client-local widgets with no interval re-render only on event.
  `clock` re-renders every minute by default; `interval` overrides.
- `exec` widgets re-render every `interval`. The client batches
  re-renders to once per frame (max ~60 Hz).
- Slot contents render left-to-right with no implicit separator. Use
  `text` widgets for separators.

### 8.5 What the status bar is not

- Not multi-row. One row — bottom of the outer terminal by default,
  top with `position = "top"` (§8.1). If you need more, dedicate a
  pane.
- Not themable via a styling engine. Per-widget `style` tables only.
- Not server-rendered. Every client owns its chrome. This is what
  enables a future GUI client with native chrome to coexist with the
  TUI client trivially.

### 8.6 Agent attention (the asked chrome)

When an agent in a pane blocks for a human answer, the server emits
`AgentEvent::Asked` on the subscribed event stream
([ADR-0035](../../ADR/0035-agent-asked-event.md); detection sources in
[ADR-0036](../../ADR/0036-agent-asked-detection.md)). The interactive
TUI folds that event into per-pane state (the same fold as the
ADR-0033 `TerminalControl` badge) and renders it on every chrome
surface that names windows, colored by the `attention` theme slot
(§4.4):

- **Window tab marker.** The asking pane's window gets a ` !` suffix on
  its tab, in both the sidebar strip and the status bar's `windows`
  widget — including for a background window, so the question is
  findable from anywhere. (The sidebar marker is themed; the `windows`
  widget marker rides the segment's own style, like the zoom `Z`.)
- **Status-bar hint.** A right-aligned `[ ASK ]` chip on the bar row
  (`[ ASK xN ]` when several panes are asking), sitting left of the
  ADR-0033 supervisory badge when one is up.

**Clearing rule.** Attention clears when the client forwards key or
paste input to the asking pane — i.e. you focused it and typed
(presumably answering). Merely focusing or clicking the pane does
*not* clear it: looking at a question is not answering it. A repeated
`Asked` for a still-flagged pane changes nothing; the flag re-raises
on the next `Asked` after input cleared it. The flag is client-local
and per-attach — it does not persist across detach/reattach (a
re-emitted `Asked` from the ADR-0036 detector re-raises it).

## 9. Hooks

> **Status:** Partially shipped (phux-r82.1). Config parsing for
> `[[hooks.<name>]]` entries ships in `phux-config` (see `schema.rs`),
> and the server-side dispatcher (`phux-server::hooks`) fires a starter
> set of real events: `after-new-pane`, `pane-exit`, `focus-changed`,
> `client-attached`, and `client-detached`. Enabled plugin manifests'
> `[[events]]` entries whose `on` names one of these events fire through
> the same dispatcher. The remaining hook points in the table below
> (`after-new-session`, `after-new-window`, `after-kill-pane`,
> `output-silenced`, `output-active`) stay design intent — the server
> does not observe those edges yet.

Hooks fire at named events. Each hook in the config is an
array-of-tables (TOML `[[hooks.<name>]]`) of `{ when, action }` pairs.

```toml
[[hooks.after-new-pane]]
when   = { cwd-startswith = "/Users/phall/work" }
action = { kind = "message", text = "in work tree" }

[[hooks.pane-exit]]
when   = { exit-code = 0 }
action = "noop"

[[hooks.pane-exit]]
when   = { exit-code = "*" }
action = { kind = "run", command = "say 'pane exited'" }
```

The hook system is intentionally small:

- **Match clauses** (`when = { key = value }`) are exact-string or
  simple glob matches (`"*"`). No regex; no expression language.
- **First match wins** per hook event. Subsequent entries don't fire.
- **Async by default.** Hook actions fire and the server moves on. Sync
  hooks (where the result blocks the trigger) are reserved for v0.2.

Hook points (initial):

| Hook                  | Fires after / on                         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `after-new-session`   | session creation                         |
| `after-new-window`    | window creation                          |
| `after-new-pane`      | pane creation, before exec               |
| `after-kill-pane`     | pane removed from layout                 |
| `pane-exit`           | inner process exit                       |
| `client-attached`     | client attach completed                  |
| `client-detached`     | client detach (any reason)               |
| `focus-changed`       | any client changes focus                 |
| `output-silenced`     | configurable silence threshold elapsed   |
| `output-active`       | first byte after a silence               |

Server-side execution semantics (the shipped subset):

- **Child processes only.** There is no in-process plugin host. A `run`
  action's `command` may be a string (executed via `/bin/sh -c`) or an
  argv array (executed directly). `noop` matches and does nothing;
  other action kinds (e.g. `message`) are client-side and the server
  dispatcher skips them (the entry still consumes the event under
  first-match-wins).
- **Event context rides environment variables.** Every hook child gets
  `PHUX_EVENT` plus one `PHUX_*` variable per context key:
  `PHUX_TERMINAL_ID`, `PHUX_SESSION`, `PHUX_EXIT_CODE` (absent for
  signal-killed children), `PHUX_CLIENT_ID`. Plugin event hooks
  additionally get `PHUX_PLUGIN_ID`, `PHUX_PLUGIN_EVENT_ID`, and
  `PHUX_PLUGIN_ROOT`, and run with the plugin root as their working
  directory.
- **Fire-and-forget, bounded.** Events queue onto the dispatcher through
  a non-blocking bounded channel (a full queue drops the event); at most
  a fixed number of hook children run concurrently, each under a timeout
  with kill-on-drop. A slow or wedged hook never blocks the terminal
  actor hot path.

## 10. Recording and playback

> **Status:** Design — implementation pending a ticket filed during the
> ADR-0013 follow-up sweep. Neither `phux capture --record` nor
> `phux play` exists in the crates today, but the underlying
> mechanism is now mechanical: under ADR-0013 the pane content on the
> wire *is* the byte stream we would want to record.

`phux capture --record TARGET --out FILE.cast` records a pane's session
to an [asciinema] v3-compatible file. v3 is a strict superset of v2 in
the features we need; players that only know v2 read v3 with reduced
fidelity rather than failing.

The record path is a tee on the server's outbound `PANE_OUTPUT` byte
stream for the target pane, wrapped in asciinema timing metadata.
There is no diff-to-bytes conversion step — the bytes are already
what we need.

Replay is `phux play FILE.cast` — a thin wrapper that streams the
recorded bytes into a new pane (via `INPUT_RAW`, where the server's
canonical `Terminal` parses them like any other PTY output). We do
not ship a full player; the ecosystem has plenty.

We do not record per-keystroke timing client-side; recordings reflect
output as the server emitted it, which keeps the recording infrastructure
server-local.

## 11. Things we explicitly do not ship

Repeating from `CONTRIBUTING.md` because the design decisions here lean
on these:

- **No embedded scripting language.** No tmux-style `if-shell`, no
  format-template DSL with conditionals. Templates are interpolation
  only.
- **No tmux-style copy-mode reimplementation.** No second parser for
  selection boundaries, no mouse drag selection, and no custom clipboard
  format path. The client may expose a focused-pane copy-mode projection
  for cursor movement, viewport scrolling, highlighting, and literal
  search over mirrored scrollback, then delegate extraction/formatting to
  libghostty and native clipboard behavior.
- **No multi-row status bar, no widgets, no themes-as-config.** The
  status bar is one row. Themes are color slots, not a styling engine.
- **No embedded plugin runtime in core.** Plugin manifests are declarative
  config today. Future runtime surfaces execute argv commands over the
  same CLI/socket contract instead of embedding a scripting language.
- **No homegrown crypto.** Transport is the right layer; SSH and Unix
  socket perms cover it.

| New-pane CWD inheritance      | `inherit-focused` (tmux-shaped)          |
| Spawn-on-attach               | `defaults.shell` (unset = inherit)       |
| Session name template         | `"default"` (supports `${cwd-basename}`) |
| Window-size policy            | `smallest` (shared Terminal geometry, ADR-0027) |
| Status bar                    | `[{ kind = "windows" }]` / `[{ kind = "help-hints" }]` / `["session-name", { kind = "time", format = " %H:%M" }]` |
| Status bar position           | `bottom` (`[status] position`, or `top`) |
| Activity / silence thresholds | activity off; silence 2 min when enabled |
| Resize on attach              | aggregate min bounding box per session   |
| Cursor blink                  | follow inner program request             |

## 13. First-time use

A new user, fresh install, no config file:

```sh
$ phux
# spawns server, creates session "default" with one window/one pane
# running $SHELL in $PWD
# attaches the client and renders
# status bar shows "0:shell | C-a ? help | C-a : palette | C-a [ copy | default 21:14"
$ C-a c           # new window
$ C-a d           # detach
$ phux            # re-attach to "default"; full state replayed
```

Discoverability: the default status bar keeps the highest-value prefix
affordances visible without consuming pane space. If the prefix is
rebound, the `help-hints` widget renders the configured prefix.

Beyond that, two client-rendered overlays teach the bindings themselves
(the TUI owns its chrome — nothing here is server-rendered):

- `C-a ?` opens the **help modal**, a centered reference listing every
  prefix-table and global binding. Esc (or `?` again) dismisses it.
- Press `C-a` and *hesitate*, and the **which-key popup** appears after
  `which-key-delay-ms` (default 600 ms), listing the available prefix
  continuations. Any key dismisses it and executes normally; Esc cancels
  the prefix. See §5.6.

## 14. Out of scope, but on the radar

These are not in v0.1 but the design accommodates them so they don't
require breaking changes:

- **Resilient remote transport** (zmosh-style UDP/SSP). Hooks into the
  `Transport` abstraction in the wire spec (see
  [`../spec/proto.md`](../spec/proto.md) §4).
- **Native GUI client** (libghostty surface). Talks the same protocol
  as the TUI client — the client's `libghostty_vt::Terminal` already
  parses `PANE_OUTPUT` bytes locally (ADR-0013); a GUI client swaps
  the TUI's `RenderState`-to-VT renderer for a `RenderState`-to-GPU
  renderer and reuses everything else.
- **Multi-user shared sessions.** Today's protocol already supports
  multiple clients per session; ACL and identity will be a future
  authenticated transport addition.
- **Tabbed layouts** (nested tab containers). The wire spec (see
  [`../spec/L3.md`](../spec/L3.md) §3.2) reserves
  the `TABBED` layout node.
- **Image protocols** (sixel, kitty graphics). Under ADR-0013 these
  ride on the `PANE_OUTPUT` byte stream like any other VT sequence;
  per-client gating happens in the server's capability rewriter
  (see [`../spec/proto.md`](../spec/proto.md) §6.2). The `Sixel` / `KittyGraphics` / `Iterm2` capability
  bits already exist; the work is in the rewriter, not the wire
  format.
- **tmux control mode (CC) frontend.** Optional adapter that would let
  a CC-aware terminal (iTerm2 today; Ghostty when 1.4+ binds its
  parser to the GUI) render phux Terminals as native splits of that
  terminal. The native byte-stream protocol (ADR-0013) stays primary
  and strictly more capable; CC is one possible alternative consumer,
  not a roadmap commitment. Per
  [ADR-0017](../../ADR/0017-tui-not-protocol-privileged.md) the
  reference TUI has no protocol-level privilege, so a CC adapter
  picks its tier set (typically L1+L3) the same way the native TUI
  does. The earlier `CC_FRONTEND` capability bit in the wire spec
  (see [`../spec/proto.md`](../spec/proto.md) §6.2)
  is **reclaimed** under ADR-0017; no capability bit is needed.
