# The internal Rust client library

**TL;DR.** `phux-client` is the unpublished, in-tree Rust library behind the
CLI and MCP adapter. Its programmatic control surface is a set of async free
functions for selection, snapshots, input, commands, waits, events, and asks;
it has no typed client facade or stable public SDK contract. External callers
should use the CLI or MCP adapter.

---

## What it is

There is no published `phux-client-sdk` crate and no gRPC service.
`phux-client` exists inside the workspace and powers the CLI agent verbs and
the [MCP adapter](./mcp.md), but downstream consumers cannot depend on a
versioned crates.io package yet. It wraps the `phux-protocol` codec and the
internal resolution, snapshot, run, and wait functions used by the binaries.

Its transport operations speak **L1**, the terminal substrate
([`../spec/L1.md`](../spec/L1.md)): terminal lifecycle, input atoms, snapshots,
and events. The crate also contains client-side L3 helpers for session/window
selection and layout; those model conventions over L1 state rather than adding
a privileged wire tier ([`../spec/L3.md`](../spec/L3.md)).

It is one consumer among peers — the reference TUI, the [web client](./web.md),
the [CLI agent surface](./agents.md), and the [MCP adapter](./mcp.md) — none
protocol-privileged ([ADR-0017](../../ADR/0017-tui-not-protocol-privileged.md)).

## How it fits the projection thesis

[ADR-0030](../../ADR/0030-engine-delegated-wire-and-projection-consumers.md)
states the wire carries opaque terminal bytes, not structured screen state.
A consumer that wants structure computes it from an engine it runs. The
reference shape for that is [phux-web](./web.md): Rust to WASM, loading
`ghostty-vt.wasm`, projecting the grid locally (ADR-0030 §4).

`phux-client` is the native-side library for the same pattern. Today it leans
on the server's engine-convenience snapshots (`GET_SCREEN` /
`GET_TERMINAL_STATE`, [`../spec/L1.md`](../spec/L1.md)) to read screen state
rather than running a local engine; those are a convenience over the shared
engine, not a normative structured wire tier, and a consumer that wants to
own its projection follows phux-web's carry-your-own-engine shape instead.
Either way the wire stays identical; only the projection differs.

## Free-function surface

There is no `Agent` handle. The CLI and MCP adapter compose the crate's module
functions directly:

- `selector::{parse, resolve, resolve_with_tags, pick_target_pane}` parses the
  CLI target grammar and resolves it against a `SessionSnapshot`.
- `snapshot::{get_screen, get_screen_scrollback}` reads structured screen
  state without attaching or resizing the terminal.
- `send_keys::{send, send_to}` routes input to a focused or already-resolved
  terminal.
- `run::{run, run_in}` submits a command and returns a `RunOutcome` with its
  captured `RunResult` or timeout state.
- `wait::poll_until` polls screen state for a `Condition` and returns a
  `WaitResult`.
- `watch::{watch_events, collect_events}` consumes the pushed `AgentEvent`
  stream continuously or with finite bounds.
- `ask::report` reports an `AskedPayload` to the existing event stream.

The async operation functions open the connections they need and return
`attach::AttachError` for transport, protocol, or server refusal failures.
The selector helpers are synchronous and operate on caller-provided snapshots.
These are workspace-internal Rust APIs, not a compatibility facade. Use the
[CLI agent surface](./agents.md) or [MCP adapter](./mcp.md) outside the
workspace. Their `ScreenState`, `RunResult`, and `WaitOutcome` JSON shapes are
versioned, though still pre-1.0.

## Where to read

- The structured shapes (`ScreenState`, `RunResult`, exit-code semantics):
  [`agents.md`](./agents.md).
- The thin JSON-RPC wrapper over the same `phux-client` functions:
  [`mcp.md`](./mcp.md).
- The L1 message catalog the library speaks:
  [`../spec/L1.md`](../spec/L1.md).
- The wire codec the library encodes against:
  [`../spec/appendix-encoding.md`](../spec/appendix-encoding.md).
- The projection thesis that places this crate among its peers:
  [ADR-0030](../../ADR/0030-engine-delegated-wire-and-projection-consumers.md) §4.
