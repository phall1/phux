# phux actions reference

**TL;DR.** Every action a keybinding, palette row, context menu, or hook can dispatch, with its parameter surface and where the command palette offers it. Rendered from the same in-code inventories the dispatcher and palette are test-pinned to, so an action is listed here exactly when the binary handles it.

An action is what a keybinding, palette row, context-menu entry, or hook binds to: a bare name, or a name plus parameters (`{ action = "split-pane", direction = "vertical" }` in config TOML). The table lists every action the TUI dispatcher handles, in the canonical `ACTION_NAMES` order; unit tests pin this inventory to the dispatcher and the command palette, so an action appears here exactly when the binary handles it.

The **Palette** column is the command-palette section the action is offered under; a dash means the palette deliberately has no row for it (reasons follow the table). An empty **Parameters** cell means the action takes none.

| `rename-window` | Window | `name?` (bare opens an interactive prompt) | Rename the active window (interactive prompt) |

| `next-attention` | Pane |  | Jump to the next pane waiting for an answer |
| `return-from-attention` | Pane |  | Return to where attention navigation started |
| `switch-session` | — | `name`; `window?` (window index to select after the switch); `pane?` (DFS leaf ordinal to focus in that window); `host?` (a satellite of this hub: opens that session's active pane here through the relay instead of re-attaching) | Re-attach this client to another session |
| `new-session` | Session | `name?` (bare opens an interactive prompt) | Create a new session and switch to it |
| `take-input` | Pane |  | Take the wheel: seize exclusive input over the focused pane (ADR-0033) |

Why the dash rows have no palette entry:

- `command-palette` — it is an entry alias for the finder, so listing it inside the finder would recurse.
- `show-help` — it is an entry alias for the same finder as `command-palette`, so listing it would duplicate that surface.
- `select-window` — parameterized by `index`, which the palette has no UI to collect; the window picker is the surface for "jump to window N".
- `switch-session` — requires a `name` arg supplied by the session picker (or the fleet's foreign rows), so a bare palette row would have no target to act on.
- `copy-mode` — a modal input surface entered from its keybinding, not a one-shot command the palette can commit.
- `plugin-action` — its palette rows are built dynamically from enabled plugins' manifests, one per manifest action, carrying `plugin`/`action` args a static row could not supply.
- `plugin-pane` — same shape as `plugin-action`: dynamic rows from enabled plugins' manifest `[[panes]]`, carrying `plugin`/`pane` args.
- `focus-pane` — parameterized by coordinates only the agent-fleet dashboard's rows can supply (the `select-window` precedent).
