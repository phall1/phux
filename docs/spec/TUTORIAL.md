# Protocol 101: a complete session walkthrough

**TL;DR.** One phux session traced end to end, from HELLO to detach: what each step does, the wire frames it sends, and why the design lands where it does. Read it before the reference specs; it is the narrative spine the per-tier docs assume you have already seen. Wire bodies here are illustrative shapes, not byte layouts; the normative encoding lives in the specs each step links.

---

## The big picture

A phux session, in one breath: a client connects to a server, negotiates capabilities, attaches to a terminal (or creates one), receives a stream of VT bytes as the PTY emits them, sends keypresses and mouse events back, and eventually detaches. The flow is asymmetric on purpose. The server sends opaque terminal **bytes**; the client sends **structured** input events. Both ends run the same terminal engine (libghostty), so neither side re-encodes terminal state into a second model — the bytes go straight onto the wire and are parsed once on each end.

Protocol version for this walkthrough is `0.3.0`.

---

## Step 1: HELLO negotiation

**What happens:** the client connects over a Unix socket (or SSH stdin/stdout), declares the versions it speaks, and advertises its capabilities.

```
Client sends (frame type 0x01):
  HELLO {
    versions: [{ min: 0.3.0, max: 0.3.0 }],
    client_caps: {
      layers: 0x01,              // L1 only
      color: TrueColor,
      kbd_protocols: 0x03,       // kitty + modifyOtherKeys
      mouse_protocols: 0x01,     // standard mouse
      hyperlinks: true,
      output_mode: Raw,          // byte-faithful PTY broadcast
    }
  }

Server replies (frame type 0x80):
  HELLO_OK {
    version: 0.3.0,
    server_caps: {
      layers: 0x05,              // L1 + L3 implemented (no L2 tier)
      features: 0x01,            // REATTACH_REPLAY enabled
      max_message_size: 16777216,
    },
    server_id: "phux-server-abc123"
  }
```

**Wire shape:** see [proto.md §6.1](./proto.md). Key pieces:

- `versions` lists the semantic version ranges the client accepts; the server selects the highest version that lies in some range and that it also supports, then echoes it back.
- `layers` is a bitset: `0x01` is L1 only, `0x05` is L1+L3. The negotiated tier set is the intersection of the two `layers` fields; an agent declares L1, a TUI declares L1+L3. The L2 bit (`0x02`) is reserved but unused — there is no collection tier (see [L2.md](./L2.md)).
- The capability fields (color, keyboard, mouse, hyperlinks) tell the server how to downsample the outbound byte stream. If the client advertises `Indexed256`, the server rewrites truecolor SGR codes to their 256-color equivalents before forwarding.

`HELLO.client_caps` carries a legacy `rendering` field (`Diff` vs. `VtReplay`); it is deprecated and ignored. With `TERMINAL_OUTPUT` carrying VT bytes, every client renders by local libghostty parse, so there is no structured-diff alternative to select. See [proto.md §6.2](./proto.md).

**Why it matters:** negotiation happens once and fixes the contract for the whole connection — version, capabilities, and which tiers the two sides will use.

---

## Step 2: Attach to a terminal

**What happens:** after HELLO, the client picks a terminal to watch. It can attach to an existing terminal or create one, and it declares the role it wants on that terminal.

```
Client sends (frame type 0x02):
  ATTACH {
    target: CREATE_IF_MISSING {
      name: "scratch",           // L3 name key, resolved client-side
      command: None,             // use the server's default shell
      cwd: None,                 // use the server's default cwd
    },
    viewport: { cols: 120, rows: 40 },
    request_scrollback: false,
    scrollback_limit_lines: 0,
    role_policy: {
      requested_role: PRIMARY,
      takeover: NEVER,
    },
  }

Server replies (frame type 0x81):
  ATTACHED {
    snapshot: SubstrateSnapshot { terminals: [...], collections: [], metadata_keys: [] },
    initial_client_id: ClientId(7),
  }
```

**Wire shape:** [L1.md §state replay](./L1.md) defines `ATTACH`, its `AttachTarget` union, and `RolePolicy`. The target is a tagged union — `BY_TERMINAL_ID` to attach to one running terminal, `CREATE_IF_MISSING` to spawn one if absent, and others. `viewport` carries the client's drawable size so the server can size the terminal; `role_policy` chooses `PRIMARY` (input-capable) or `VIEWER` (watch-only). `ATTACHED` is metadata only: it carries a `SubstrateSnapshot` of the tier-visible state and the client's `initial_client_id`. It carries no terminal content yet — that arrives next.

**Why it matters:** this is where the client says "I want to see and control this terminal," and which role it claims. The server then allocates a subscription and begins the replay sequence.

---

## Step 3: Receive initial state (snapshot)

**What happens:** for each terminal the client attached to, the server sends a self-contained snapshot of the current grid. This is the bootstrap payload that brings the client's local engine up to date.

```
Server sends (frame type 0x91):
  TERMINAL_SNAPSHOT {
    terminal_id: TerminalId::LOCAL(42),
    cols: 120,
    rows: 40,
    vt_replay_bytes: bytes,        // synthesized VT that reproduces the grid
    scrollback_bytes: None,        // present iff request_scrollback was true
  }
```

**Wire shape:** [L1.md §2.4](./L1.md) describes the full shape. `vt_replay_bytes` is a Mosh-style, self-contained VT byte sequence the server synthesizes from its canonical terminal: written to a fresh `libghostty_vt::Terminal` of the declared `cols × rows`, it reproduces the server's grid at snapshot time. The bytes are opaque — the client feeds them to its engine and does not parse or rewrite them. `scrollback_bytes` is present only when the client set `request_scrollback`, bounded by `scrollback_limit_lines`, and is applied before `vt_replay_bytes`.

Cursor position and terminal modes are not separate wire fields. They live inside each end's `libghostty_vt::Terminal`; a client that needs the cursor or modes queries its local engine ([L1.md §2.5](./L1.md)).

**Why it matters:** after applying the snapshot, the client's local engine grid matches the server's canonical grid. From here the live byte stream continues.

---

## Step 4: Stream terminal output

**What happens:** every time the PTY produces bytes, the server collects them (paced at a configurable refresh rate, default 60 Hz) and forwards them.

```
User types "ls" and presses Enter.

Server sends (frame type 0x90):
  TERMINAL_OUTPUT {
    terminal_id: TerminalId::LOCAL(42),
    seq: 2,
    bytes: b"ls\r\n"               // keyboard bytes, echoed by the PTY
  }

A moment later, the shell replies:

Server sends (frame type 0x90):
  TERMINAL_OUTPUT {
    terminal_id: TerminalId::LOCAL(42),
    seq: 3,
    bytes: b"Documents\r\nDownloads\r\n..."
  }

The client parses these VT bytes into its local libghostty Terminal,
renders to screen, then acknowledges:

Client sends (frame type 0x21):
  FRAME_ACK {
    terminal_id: TerminalId::LOCAL(42),
    seq: 3   // "I have applied all output up to seq 3"
  }
```

**Wire shape:** [L1.md §2](./L1.md) and [proto.md §8](./proto.md). The bytes are raw VT — no re-encoding, no structuring; the server forwards what the PTY emitted. The per-terminal `seq` is monotonic and drives flow control: a client that falls behind lets the server pace itself instead of buffering without bound. Note that `seq` does not carry across a snapshot boundary; the first `TERMINAL_OUTPUT` after a `TERMINAL_SNAPSHOT` is authoritative for the new base ([L1.md §7](./L1.md)).

**Why it matters:** this is the hot path. Sending exactly the bytes the PTY emitted preserves every terminal feature without the server modeling any of them.

---

## Step 5: Handle client input

**What happens:** the client sends a keystroke as a structured event. The server hands it to its libghostty encoder, which produces terminal-mode-aware VT bytes, and writes them to the PTY.

```
User presses Ctrl+C.

Client sends (frame type 0x10):
  INPUT_KEY {
    terminal_id: TerminalId::LOCAL(42),
    event: {
      action: PRESS,
      key: KEY_C,
      mods: { ctrl: true },
      text: None,                  // C0 controls are derived by the encoder
    }
  }

The server looks up TerminalId(42), refreshes its key encoder against
that terminal's current modes, encodes, and writes the bytes to the PTY.
The process receives SIGINT or the byte, depending on terminal mode.

A moment later, the process exits and the prompt returns:

Server sends (frame type 0x90):
  TERMINAL_OUTPUT {
    terminal_id: TerminalId::LOCAL(42),
    seq: 4,
    bytes: b"^C\r\n$ "
  }
```

**Wire shape:** [input.md](./input.md) defines the input family — `INPUT_KEY`, `INPUT_MOUSE`, `INPUT_PASTE`, `INPUT_FOCUS`, `INPUT_RAW`. Each carries a `terminal_id` and a structured event. The server's libghostty-backed encoder converts the event to mode-aware VT bytes and writes to the PTY; encoder configuration never crosses the wire. Sending input as structured data (rather than VT bytes) is what lets phux transport modifier-rich chords, the kitty keyboard protocol, IME composition, and pixel-precise mouse events end to end.

**Why it matters:** the seam is the protocol. The client never produces VT bytes; the server never sees encoder options. Each side owns one half.

---

## Step 6: Other terminal-originated events

**What happens:** the running process may emit control sequences that the server's engine parses and the server surfaces as structured events, rather than re-emitting raw escapes.

```
Process sets the window title via OSC 0:

Server sends (frame type 0xB1):
  TERMINAL_EVENT {
    terminal_id: TerminalId::LOCAL(42),
    event: TITLE { title: "my-project — vim" }
  }

Process rings the bell (BEL):

Server sends (frame type 0xB0):
  BELL {
    terminal_id: TerminalId::LOCAL(42),
  }

Process reports its working directory via OSC 7:

Server sends (frame type 0xB1):
  TERMINAL_EVENT {
    terminal_id: TerminalId::LOCAL(42),
    event: CURRENT_DIR { uri: "file:///Users/alice/workspace" }
  }
```

**Wire shape:** [L1.md §1.2–1.3](./L1.md) define `BELL` and `TERMINAL_EVENT`. The server's engine parses the OSC sequence once and forwards a structured field, so a consumer reads "the current directory" without parsing escape sequences itself. These frames are `spec-only` today; the live byte stream already carries the same OSC sequences inside `TERMINAL_OUTPUT`, so a consumer can also read title and cwd from its own engine.

**Why it matters:** structured terminal events decouple a consumer from OSC parsing. An agent sees title and cwd as fields.

---

## Step 7: Detach

**What happens:** the user quits or switches clients. The client sends `DETACH`; the server acknowledges and closes the transport.

```
Client sends (frame type 0x03):
  DETACH { }

Server replies (frame type 0x82):
  DETACHED {
    reason: REQUESTED,
    message: "detach acknowledged"
  }

The server closes the transport (UDS or SSH pipe).
The terminal keeps running on the server.
Another client can attach to it later.
```

**Wire shape:** [proto.md §7.2](./proto.md). `reason` is an enum: `REQUESTED` (clean client detach), `SERVER_SHUTDOWN`, `SESSION_KILLED` (a legacy name retained for wire compat), `REPLACED` (another client deliberately took over an exclusive attach), `PROTOCOL_ERROR`, and `INTERNAL_ERROR`.

**Why it matters:** detach is clean and does not kill the terminal; the server just stops sending it output. The next client to attach receives the snapshot — and scrollback up to the configured limit if it asks — and picks up where the previous one left off. This is the property tmux does not provide: scrollback survives detach.

## Putting it together

The complete sequence as a timeline:

```
Client                              Server                    Terminal (PTY)

  |------- ATTACH ------>             |                           |

  |              <----- TERMINAL_OUTPUT (seq 3) -------- ls output
  |------- FRAME_ACK ------>          |                           |
  |                                   |                           |
  |              <----- TERMINAL_OUTPUT (seq 4) -------- prompt   |
  |------- FRAME_ACK ------>          |                           |
  |                                   |                           |
  |------- DETACH ------>             |                           |
  |                   <------ DETACHED |                           |
  |                                   | (terminal stays alive)    |
  X                                   |                           |
```

After detach, the terminal keeps running. Its PTY is still open. Another client can attach and continue.
