# Remote access

**TL;DR.** Attach to another machine with one command. The first run attempts
to install and start its per-user phux service, pairs the host, and attaches.
Later runs use direct encrypted QUIC when the host advertises it, with an SSH
route as the automatic fallback and no phux account. Manual overlay, enroll,
and relay paths are below for when that command cannot.

---

## The short way: `phux --remote`

One command, and it reads like the one you already type:

```sh
phux --remote me@mini
```

The first time, `mini` is not a registered host, so phux pairs it before
attaching. It walks four rungs, cheapest first
([ADR-0093](adr/0093-remote-target-as-a-resolution-ladder.md)):

1. **A registered host** — a `[[remote]]` entry supplies the endpoint, the
   certificate pin, and the token, and the dial is a direct QUIC connection.
   This is the steady state and the only rung that runs once a host is known.
2. **A pasted connect code** — `--code`, below. No ssh, no shell on the far
   end.
3. **A one-time ssh bootstrap** — installs and starts the remote per-user
   service, runs `phux pair --json` over your existing ssh trust, registers
   what it mints, and dials. Once per host in the normal direct case; rung 1
   catches everything after.
4. **A refusal** naming both remedies, when ssh cannot help.

If a saved direct route later stops answering or its credentials no longer
establish a connection, the interactive `--remote` form re-enters the SSH
bootstrap once, refreshes the registry, and retries the attach. `--no-enroll`
disables both first-time bootstrap and this repair path.

`PORT` defaults to `8788`, the port a server auto-binds on its overlay
address ([ADR-0081](adr/0081-overlay-auto-listen-and-one-command-pairing.md)).
Pass `[USER@]HOST:PORT` to say otherwise; the port applies to that dial and
does not rewrite the registry.

The `user@` half is a label, not a wire identity: phux runs one server per
user and the QUIC preamble carries a bearer token, not a username, so which
server you reach is decided by the address and port. `user@` names the ssh
destination for rung 3 and the registry key that remembers the result.

### Pairing without ssh at all

If the host has no ssh you can use — or you would rather not shell into it —
run `phux pair` there, copy the one-tap link it prints, and hand it over:

```sh
phux --remote mini --code 'https://phux.phall.io/connect?url=wss://100.64.0.2:8787&fp=...&token=...'
```

That is the same link `phux pair --qr` renders for a phone, so a laptop and a
phone pair through one artifact. `--code` also accepts the link's
`phux://connect?...` spelling, which `phux pair` prints on a second line for
older app builds. The link is registered under the target's
name, and later attaches need no code.

`--no-enroll` refuses the ssh rung outright: an unregistered host is reported
with its remedies named rather than paired.

### Managing a remote host's sessions without attaching

The session verbs take the same `--remote` target, placed after the verb, so
you can create, list, rename, and kill sessions on another machine from a
local shell:

```sh
phux new --remote me@mini -s build --json -- make watch
phux ls --remote me@mini
phux rename --remote me@mini build ci
phux kill --remote me@mini ci
```

`ls`, `new`, `kill`, `rename`, and `detach` accept it. Each one resolves the
target through the same ladder as `phux --remote` and dials the same QUIC or
WSS endpoint, so a host bootstrapped once for attach needs nothing more here
(and a cold host starts and pairs over ssh the first time, exactly as attach
would). With
`--json` a cold host is refused instead of paired, with the remedies in the
error's `remedy` field: pairing narrates on stderr and ssh may prompt, and a
machine-readable call must do neither. Three limits are deliberate:

- `--remote` and `--socket` cannot combine: one names a local socket, the
  other a network dial.
- `phux kill --server --remote HOST` is refused. The server accepts its stop
  command on the local socket only, so run `phux kill --server` on that host.
- An `ssh://` registry entry is refused. It carries an interactive attach
  over `ssh -t` and nothing else; `phux host enroll HOST` gives it a direct
  QUIC endpoint the session verbs can dial.

`phux new --remote` without `--json` creates the session and attaches to it,
like the local form. With no `--cwd`, a remote session starts in the far
server's default directory: a path on this machine names nothing there.

### From Cockpit

Cockpit's Connect to Host (`cmd+shift+O`) reads this same `[[remote]]`
registry and dials through the same QUIC/WSS stack, so a host that
`phux --remote NAME` reaches is one Cockpit reaches by NAME. It does only
rung 1 of the ladder: pairing stays in the terminal, and an unregistered host
is refused with the command that pairs it. Details, including the
`phux-remote` setting and relaunch behavior, are in
[Cockpit's remote hosts](../clients/cockpit/docs/REMOTE_HOSTS.md).

### Explicit setup without attaching: `phux host enroll`

`--remote` performs the ordinary per-user service setup automatically. Use the
explicit host verb when you want to prepare or repair a machine without
attaching, select a role, or supply enrollment options:

```sh
phux host enroll mini
```

(Before the `phux host` namespace this verb was spelled `phux enroll`. See
[ADR-0066](adr/0066-host-namespace.md).)

It confirms phux is installed on `mini`, installs the host's service unit so
the server survives reboot, mints a pairing token there, reads back the
certificate fingerprint and the overlay address, writes the token locally
0600, and registers a `[[remote]]` entry. Afterwards both spellings work with
no flags:

```sh
phux attach mini
phux --remote mini
```

No token, no fingerprint, no address typed by hand. This grants nothing ssh
did not already grant — whoever can `ssh mini` can run `phux pair` there and
read the token themselves ([ADR-0055](adr/0055-always-on-server-and-ssh-bootstrapped-enrollment.md)).

A host with no overlay address, or one whose certificate could not be read,
has nothing dialable; enrollment says so and registers an `ssh://` entry
instead. That still gives you `phux attach mini` against a server whose
sessions outlive the connection — it just tunnels through ssh rather than
dialing QUIC. Re-run `phux host enroll` once the overlay is up to upgrade
the transport.

The rest of this page is the manual path: what `enroll` automates, and what
to do when it cannot reach the host.

### Joining a satellite to this hub

`--remote` and `phux host enroll` (default `--role remote`) attach *to*
another machine. To have this machine *dial* another as a federation
satellite, pass `--role satellite`:

```sh
phux host enroll --role satellite mini
```

One command, typically under a minute if `mini` already has phux and you
can `ssh mini`:

1. Confirms phux is on `mini` and installs its per-user service (launchd
   on macOS, systemd `--user` on Linux) with a QUIC listener, so the
   satellite survives logout and reboot.
2. Mints a pairing token there and pins the certificate fingerprint.
3. Registers `mini` in this machine's `[[satellites]]` registry. The token
   is stored owner-only (`0600`) under the state dir; it never lands in
   argv, `config.toml`, or logs.
4. Ensures this machine's per-user service runs with `--hub`. If a unit
   already exists, `--hub` is patched into its argv and existing
   `--quic` / `--listen` / `--restore` / `--socket` arguments stay. A
   naive `phux service install --hub` would drop them
   ([ADR-0083](adr/0083-in-place-supervisor-unit-reconcile.md)).

Afterwards this machine is the hub: host-qualified operations reach
`mini` over the hub-and-spoke link. Join stays accountless QUIC on your
overlay; there is no phux-operated relay on this path.

If the local server is already running without `--hub`, the unit is
updated and hub mode starts the next time that server starts — the
running process is not restarted, so panes stay up. `--no-service` skips
installing the *remote* unit only; the local `--hub` ensure still runs.

## Why an overlay

phux already ships everything a remote attach needs except reachability: wss://
(TLS 1.3) and QUIC transports, `phux pair` to mint a bearer token plus a
certificate fingerprint, and a non-loopback bind that engages TLS and token
auth automatically
([ADR-0031](adr/0031-remote-consumer-auth-and-encryption.md)). What remains
is purely packet reachability — a self-hosted server behind NAT or CGNAT has no
inbound-reachable address. The sanctioned answer is a WireGuard-class overlay
network ([ADR-0037](adr/0037-overlay-network-reachability.md)): an L3
substrate that hands the client a routable address (a `100.x` IP or a MagicDNS
`*.ts.net` name) which phux dials exactly like a LAN address, with zero new
code. Cert pinning is on the fingerprint, not the hostname, so overlay DNS
names work unchanged. phux is overlay-agnostic, and the fully-OSS
Headscale/WireGuard path is first-class, not a downgrade. Hosted relays,
rendezvous servers, and hole-punching are deliberately out of scope. The trust
model and environment knobs live in
[operations.md](./operations.md#connecting-from-another-network-overlay-reachability);
this page owns the step-by-step task.

## Common steps: pair, then listen

Every path below shares the same server-side setup, done once. Pairing order
does not matter: the server re-reads the credential store when it changes, so a
token minted against an already-running listener works at the next connection
attempt, and credential revocation applies just as promptly. Legacy anonymous
token lines require a one-time explicit `phux pair --migrate-legacy`. `phux pair`
never contacts a running server, and it provisions the self-signed certificate
if none exists yet, so the fingerprint it prints is the one the server will
present.

```sh
# On the server host, before starting the listener:
phux pair
```

Its output looks like this (the overlay-address block appears only when a
tailnet or CGNAT-routed address is detected on the host):

```
Credential ID (use with `phux pair rotate|revoke`):
  <credential-id>

Pairing token (a secret — give it to the device once):
  <64-hex token>

Server certificate SHA-256 (verify on the device to defeat MITM):
  <64-hex fingerprint>

Overlay network addresses (dial one of these from the device):
  100.x.y.z

Token written to <state-dir>/remote-tokens
```

Record the token and the fingerprint; every `phux attach` below uses both. The
fingerprint is SHA-256, 64 hex digits, optionally colon-separated.

Keep the non-secret credential ID for lifecycle operations. Rotation prints a
new bearer once and keeps the previous generation valid for at most five
minutes by default; `--overlap-seconds 0` cuts over immediately. An existing
absolute expiry is preserved and can shorten that overlap. An already-expired
credential cannot be rotated and produces no replacement token. Revocation
affects new connections immediately, while already-established sessions
continue until they disconnect:

```sh
phux pair rotate <credential-id> --overlap-seconds 300
phux pair revoke <credential-id>
```

For a phone or tablet, skip the transcription entirely: when the server
address is known — pass `--host HOST:PORT` (or a full `ws://`/`wss://` URL),
or let it fall back to a detected overlay address plus the `PHUX_WS_ADDR`
port — `phux pair` also prints a one-tap
`https://phux.phall.io/connect?url=…&fp=…&token=…` link carrying the URL,
fingerprint, and token together, and `phux pair --qr` renders that same link
as a scannable terminal QR. It is an https Universal Link rather than a
custom `phux://` scheme so that only the app which owns the domain can
receive it — a custom scheme is not exclusive on iOS, and the link carries a
bearer token. The same link is printed a second time as `phux://connect?…`
for app builds that predate Universal Link support. Treat the link, the QR,
and the second spelling like the token itself: they carry the credential.
`--name` labels the server in the device's list.

```sh
# Credentials + a scannable one-tap QR for the device:
phux pair --qr --host 100.x.y.z:8787 --name studio-mini
```

Then start
the listener on a non-loopback bind — TLS and token auth engage automatically:

```sh
phux server --listen 0.0.0.0:8787      # TLS WebSocket (= PHUX_WS_ADDR)
# or, for QUIC:
phux server --quic 0.0.0.0:8788        # (= PHUX_QUIC_ADDR)
```

Prefer QUIC where UDP is open — it handles roaming and connection migration
better. Use `--ws wss://` when UDP is blocked by a network or firewall.

## Path A: Tailscale

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) is the frictionless on-ramp.

1. Install Tailscale on both the server host and the client device.
2. Run `tailscale up` on each.
3. Confirm both peers appear in `tailscale status`.
4. Find the server's address: `tailscale status` prints both the `100.x.y.z`
   IP and the MagicDNS name (like `myhost.tailnet-name.ts.net`).

Then dial from the client:

```sh
# QUIC (preferred when UDP is open):
phux attach --quic myhost.tailnet-name.ts.net:8788 --token HEX --cert-fingerprint FP

# TLS WebSocket fallback (when UDP is blocked):
phux attach --ws wss://myhost.tailnet-name.ts.net:8787 --token HEX --cert-fingerprint FP
```

Routable hosts require `--cert-fingerprint` (only loopback trusts the dev
cert). The pin is fingerprint-based, so the MagicDNS name and the `100.x` IP
are interchangeable — no re-pairing when you switch between them. The honest
tradeoff: trust extends to Tailscale's coordination plane, mitigated by phux's
own TLS + token riding on top.

## Path B: Headscale

[Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) is a self-hostable,
fully-OSS control plane for the same data plane, for operators who will not
depend on a third-party coordinator. The client tooling is identical.

1. Run a Headscale server.
2. Create a user and a preauth key:
   `headscale users create NAME`, then
   `headscale preauthkeys create --user NAME`.
3. Join each node:
   `tailscale up --login-server https://headscale.example.com --authkey KEY`.
4. Verify both peers with `tailscale status`.

Dial exactly as in Path A, using the Headscale-assigned `100.x` address (or
its DNS name if configured):

```sh
phux attach --quic 100.64.0.2:8788 --token HEX --cert-fingerprint FP
# or
phux attach --ws wss://100.64.0.2:8787 --token HEX --cert-fingerprint FP
```

## Path C: Raw WireGuard

A hand-rolled [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) overlay works the same
way — all three paths look identical to phux, which only ever sees an IP.

1. Generate a keypair on both ends:
   `wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey`.
2. Write a minimal `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` on each end. Server side:

   ```ini
   [Interface]
   Address = 10.8.0.1/24
   ListenPort = 51820
   PrivateKey = <server privatekey>

   [Peer]
   PublicKey = <client publickey>
   AllowedIPs = 10.8.0.2/32
   ```

   Client side (the `Endpoint` goes on whichever side can see the other's
   public address):

   ```ini
   [Interface]
   Address = 10.8.0.2/24
   PrivateKey = <client privatekey>

   [Peer]
   PublicKey = <server publickey>
   AllowedIPs = 10.8.0.1/32
   Endpoint = server.example.com:51820
   PersistentKeepalive = 25
   ```

3. Bring the tunnel up on both ends: `wg-quick up wg0`.
4. Verify a recent handshake with `wg show`.

Dial the peer's tunnel address:

```sh
phux attach --quic 10.8.0.1:8788 --token HEX --cert-fingerprint FP
# or
phux attach --ws wss://10.8.0.1:8787 --token HEX --cert-fingerprint FP
```

With raw WireGuard there is no MagicDNS; use the tunnel IP or your own DNS.

## Path D: via a reference relay

Paths A-C put both ends on one overlay so the client can reach the server's
address. A relay inverts the direction: the server dials out to a relay you
host, and consumers dial the relay — nothing on the server's network needs
to accept an inbound connection. The tradeoff is stated plainly: the relay
terminates TLS on both legs and sees phux traffic in plaintext. Self-hosting
the relay on a trusted machine is the mitigation.

Set up the route end to end:

1. On the relay host, run `phux relay pair --route ROUTE`, save its printed
   tunnel token out of band, then start
   `phux relay run --listen 0.0.0.0:4433`.
2. On the server host, put that tunnel token in a mode-`0600` file and add:

   ```toml
   [[connector]]
   relay = "RELAY_HOST:4433"
   token-file = "/home/me/.local/state/phux/relay-route.token"
   cert-fingerprint = "RELAY_FP"
   ```

3. Start or restart `phux server`. It supervises every configured connector;
   `--connect RELAY_HOST:4433` selects one exact entry for diagnosis.
4. Attach the consumer, using the route as TLS SNI and the server's ordinary
   `phux pair` token as the consumer credential:

   ```sh
   phux attach --quic RELAY_HOST:4433 --tls-server-name ROUTE \
     --cert-fingerprint RELAY_FP --token SERVER_TOKEN
   ```

`RELAY_FP` pins the relay's certificate on both network legs.
`SERVER_TOKEN` crosses the relay opaquely and is verified by the server;
the tunnel token only authorizes the connector to claim its enrolled route.
The connector re-reads its token file on every redial, so rotation is
`phux relay pair --route ROUTE`, replace the file, then restart either side
when immediate cutover is required.

An unknown route fails the TLS handshake. An enrolled route with no live
tunnel closes as route-offline. A bad tunnel token or certificate pin leaves
the local server running and produces an `outbound connector lost; scheduling
redial` diagnostic. A bad `SERVER_TOKEN` resets only that consumer stream;
the tunnel and other consumers remain live. Full relay state-file,
revocation, and trust-boundary details are in
[operations.md](./operations.md#running-the-reference-relay); the design is
ADR-0057, building on
[ADR-0051](adr/0051-outbound-dial-out-connector-transport.md) and
[ADR-0052](adr/0052-connector-route-identity-and-config.md).

## Troubleshooting

Failures fall into a few classes, and the symptom tells you which one you have.

- **No route / connection timed out / connection refused.** An overlay
  problem, not a phux problem. Check `tailscale status` (both peers listed and
  not `offline`) and `tailscale ping <host>` on Tailscale/Headscale, or `wg
  show` for a recent handshake on raw WireGuard. Confirm the server binds an
  address the overlay routes (`0.0.0.0:8787` or the overlay IP itself) and
  that no host firewall drops the port. QUIC needs UDP end to end — if QUIC
  times out but wss:// works, UDP is blocked; stay on `--ws`.
- **Auth failure** (HTTP 401 / unauthorized on the WebSocket upgrade; QUIC
  token rejection). The link is fine; the bearer token is missing, mistyped,
  or was revoked. Mint one with `phux pair`; it is live at the next connection
  attempt, with no restart. The 401 is returned before any phux frame is read,
  so a 401 proves reachability.
- **Insecure credential store.** The default store and any path selected by
  `PHUX_WS_TOKENS` must be a regular, non-symlink file owned by the effective
  user with no group or world permissions. Restore owner-only permissions
  (normally `chmod 600 <path>`); authentication fails closed until repaired.
- **Fingerprint mismatch.** The certificate the server presented does not
  match `--cert-fingerprint`. Either the pinned value is stale (the server
  state dir was recreated, regenerating `remote-cert.pem`), an operator
  certificate was substituted via `PHUX_WS_TLS_CERT`/`PHUX_WS_TLS_KEY`, or you
  are dialing the wrong host. Re-run `phux pair` on the server host — it
  re-prints the persisted certificate's fingerprint without contacting the
  running server — and compare. Do not "fix" a mismatch by dropping the flag:
  the pin is what closes the trust-on-first-use MITM window.
- **Certificate name mismatch** (`IP address mismatch`, `NotValidForName`,
  `ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`) from a client that validates the server name
  — `curl --cacert`, a browser with the certificate trusted, `openssl s_client
  -verify_ip`. `phux attach` and the mobile app never hit this: they pin the
  fingerprint and ignore the name. The certificate's subjectAltName is fixed
  when it is generated ([ADR-0091](adr/0091-certificate-names-the-advertised-address.md)),
  so one minted before phux learned to name the overlay address claims only
  loopback and always will. `phux doctor` reports it as `remote-cert` and prints
  the remedy. Widening it means a **new certificate and a new fingerprint**,
  which un-pairs every paired device; do it deliberately or not at all:

  ```sh
  rm ~/.local/state/phux/remote-cert.pem ~/.local/state/phux/remote-key.pem
  phux pair            # regenerates, naming the address it advertises
  ```

  then re-pair every device against the new fingerprint.
- **MagicDNS name does not resolve.** MagicDNS may be disabled on the tailnet,
  or the client OS resolver is not wired up; fall back to the `100.x` IP from
  `tailscale status`. The pin is on the fingerprint, not the hostname, so
  switching between name and IP needs no re-pairing.

Overlay links are higher-latency than a LAN; remote consumers get better
behavior by requesting state-sync output — see
[operations.md](./operations.md#output-mode-for-remote-consumers).

## Scope and alternatives

`ssh HOST phux stdio-bridge` remains a valid manual path where SSH is already
the trust boundary — no token or pin is involved on that transport. Hosted
relay infrastructure, rendezvous servers, STUN/TURN, and reverse tunnels
remain deliberately out of scope for the self-host repo; the self-hosted
reference relay (Path D above) is the one carve-out, per ADR-0057. See
[ADR-0037](adr/0037-overlay-network-reachability.md). For the full attach
and pair CLI surface, see [the reference TUI](./consumers/tui.md).
