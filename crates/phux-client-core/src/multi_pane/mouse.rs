/// Outcome of a click hit-test against the current multi-pane composition.
///
/// The driver consumes this to decide three independent things:
///
/// 1. Which `TerminalId` (if any) the resulting `INPUT_MOUSE` frame
///    targets — and what the pane-local coordinates are.
/// 2. Whether `LayoutState.focus` needs to swap to a different pane
///    (click-to-focus, per ADR-0019 decision 6 + DESIGN §7).
/// 3. Whether a divider repaint is required because focus changed
///    (heavy / light chrome moves with focus).
///
/// A click on a divider cell returns [`RouteDecision::Divider`] carrying
/// the controlling split's node path + axis, so the driver's drag machine
/// can adjust that split's ratio (ADR-0035). A click that falls outside
/// every pane rect *and* every divider cell (reserved chrome, degenerate
/// viewport) returns [`RouteDecision::Miss`] and is dropped.

/// * Click on a divider cell ⇒ [`RouteDecision::Divider`] carrying the
///   split that cell controls (path + axis) for drag-to-resize.
/// * Click outside any pane and any divider (reserved chrome, degenerate
///   viewport, undersized tree) ⇒ [`RouteDecision::Miss`].
