//! Prediction state — the queue of in-flight predictions and the policy
//! that decides which keystrokes are safe to predict.
//!
//! The prediction state is *cursor-anchored*, not *cell-anchored*: each
//! prediction records the (row, col) at which it expects to paint, plus
//! the character to paint there. The state machine maintains a small
//! cursor estimate that walks forward by one column per printable
//! prediction and backward by one column per backspace prediction, so
//! consecutive predictions stack into a horizontal run.
//!
//! See the module-level docs in [`super`] for the rationale on which key
//! classes are predicted and why the visual decoration is underline.
