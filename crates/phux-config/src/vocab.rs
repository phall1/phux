//! Validation vocabulary: the canonical action-name and hook-event-name
//! lists, plus a did-you-mean helper (phux-i0e8.3.1).
//!
//! phux-config owns the vocabulary that `phux config check` (and the
//! runtime error paths) validate against. The string values here are the
//! single source of truth; the historical definition sites re-export them
//! so call sites did not churn:
//!
//! - [`ACTION_NAMES`] moved in from
//!   `phux-client::attach::input_dispatch`, which re-exports it. The
//!   dispatcher's `run_action` match arms and the command-palette
//!   registry are pinned to this list by unit tests in phux-client.
//! - The hook event consts ([`AFTER_NEW_PANE`] .. [`AGENT_STATE_CHANGED`])
//!   moved in from `phux-server::hooks`, which re-exports them.
//!   [`HOOK_EVENTS`] is the aggregate list for validators.
//!
//! [`hook_context_keys`] and [`hook_action_is_executable`]
//! (phux-i0e8.3.3) describe what a `[[hooks.<event>]]` entry can
//! legitimately reference: the context keys an event's `when` clauses
//! can match, and whether the action ever executes server-side. Both
//! are pinned to `phux-server::hooks` by agreement tests there.
//!
//! [`did_you_mean`] is a small in-crate Levenshtein suggester so
//! diagnostics can turn "unknown action `kill-pain`" into "did you mean
//! `kill-pane`?" without a new dependency.
