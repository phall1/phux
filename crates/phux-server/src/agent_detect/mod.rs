//! Level-triggered agent-state detector (ADR-0046).
//!
//! # Why level-triggered
//!
//! The obvious design is edge-triggered: have the agent's shell hooks fire
//! on start and stop. It is also wrong. An edge-triggered reporter is lossy
//! — miss ONE transition (a crash, a `kill -9`, a hook that did not fire,
//! a race at startup) and the pane lies forever, with no path back to the
//! truth. A periodic re-derivation from the screen re-establishes ground
//! truth every tick and is therefore **self-healing**: however we got into
//! a wrong state, the next tick fixes it.
//!
//! # The trust model
//!
//! [`AgentDetector::tick`] implements it, in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Identify** the agent from the PTY's foreground process group.
//! 2. **Grace** — publish nothing for [`STARTUP_GRACE`] after IDENTIFICATION
//!    while a splash screen paints, so we never flash `blocked` at launch.
//!    Anchored there and not at pane creation: a pane seeds a shell, and the
//!    common way an agent appears is a human typing `claude` into it minutes
//!    later, which is exactly the launch the guard exists for.
//! 3. **Derive** a state from the manifest's region-scoped rules.
//!    *Fail safe:* identified but nothing matched means [`DetectedState::Idle`],
//!    **never** `Blocked`. A missed notification is cheap; a permanently-red
//!    sidebar destroys the user's trust in the whole feature, which is
//!    strictly worse than having no feature.
//! 4. **Hysteresis, asymmetric.** The UX thesis in one line: *transitions
//!    that demand attention are instant; transitions that release it are
//!    debounced.* `blocked` and `working` publish on the FIRST tick that
//!    sees them. `working -> idle` is the ambiguous one — the screen stopped
//!    saying "working" but does not positively say "idle" (a spinner cleared
//!    mid-redraw) — so it is held for [`IDLE_CONFIRMATIONS`] ticks, capped at
//!    [`IDLE_HOLD_CAP`], and the hold is BYPASSED when a rule supplies
//!    positive idle evidence.
//! 5. **Edge-filtered publish.** Only a genuinely changed tuple is emitted.
//!    An agent that is `working` and spewing output for ten minutes produces
//!    ZERO metadata writes and ZERO events.
//!
//! Staleness needs no TTL: identity is re-derived every [`IDENTIFY_RECHECK`],
//! so a dead agent's badge is actively *retracted* rather than left to spin
//! forever. A dead process must not lie.
