//! Structural sub-slices of the live screen (ADR-0046 §C).
//!
//! A rule never matches against the whole screen. It matches against a
//! **region**: a structurally derived sub-slice of the *live viewport*
//! (never scrollback). This is the decisive idea of the detector. The
//! string `"do you want to proceed?"` sitting inside a diff that an agent
//! just printed means nothing; the same string inside the live prompt box
//! means the agent is blocked on a human. Region selection converts a
//! fuzzy text-matching problem into a mostly structural one, which is what
//! makes a false `blocked` — the one failure mode that destroys trust in
//! the whole feature — rare enough to ship.
//!
//! Every extractor borrows from the caller's line buffer; none allocate a
//! new `String`.

/// The live screen a rule set is evaluated against.
