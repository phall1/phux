///   its name unchanged — the caller's `prepare_attach` then runs the
///   normal `ByName` attach path against it. No duplicate session is
///   created.
/// * Otherwise, seed a fresh `(session, window, pane)` triple, spawn
///   the seed pane's actor in the mode the server was configured
///   with (PTY-backed via [`seed_session_with_pty`] when
///   [`crate::state::ServerState::attach_create_seeds_pty`] is `true`,
///   or no-PTY via [`seed_session_with_actor`] otherwise), and return
///   the name so the caller proceeds with the normal attach path.
///
/// `command` from the wire frame is honored only when the PTY mode is
/// on AND no explicit
/// [`crate::state::ServerState::attach_create_seed_command`] preempts
/// it: an explicit per-server seed command always wins (it's how the
/// `phux server` binary pins `default_shell_command()` for the user).
/// `cwd` from the wire frame (phux-3mtf) seeds the PTY child's working
/// directory when it names an existing directory on the server host; a
/// missing or non-directory path falls back to the pre-existing
/// behavior (the builder's cwd stays unset, so the spawn lands where a
/// `cwd: None` spawn would) rather than failing the attach — the
/// client's idea of a path may be stale or belong to another host. A
/// cwd already set on the server-wide override command is never
/// clobbered. The no-PTY path ignores both, matching the existing
/// `seed_session_with_actor` shape.
///
/// On terminal-actor spawn failure (e.g. PTY allocation fails on a
/// host with no remaining ptys), emits a `SessionNotFound` error
/// frame (mirroring how the pre-seed path logs-and-continues at
/// startup) and returns `None` so the attach fails atomically. We
/// reuse `SessionNotFound` rather than introducing a new error code:
/// the user-visible effect is "the requested session is not available
/// to attach to", which is what `SessionNotFound` already means on
/// the wire. A richer error code (e.g. `SessionCreateFailed`) is a
/// SPEC-level follow-up.

/// phux-2lj: Apply the ATTACH viewport to every pane in the freshly-
/// attached session.
///
/// Panes are spawned at a hardcoded 80x24 default ([`seed_session_with_pty`]
/// / [`seed_session_with_actor`]) because the session may exist before any
/// client attaches (e.g. `phux-server` pre-seeding). On the first attach
/// we have to size the PTY to match the client's outer viewport, otherwise
/// full-screen TUIs (vim, htop) think they're running in 24 rows and
/// render into a fraction of the visible area. This mirrors what
/// [`crate::runtime::commands::handle_viewport_resize`] does for a live
/// `VIEWPORT_RESIZE` frame.
///
/// The resize is fire-and-forget on the per-actor mpsc channel — same
/// primitive `handle_viewport_resize` and `handle_terminal_resize` use.
/// We `try_send` rather than `.await` so we can stay in a sync helper
/// (no impact on `handle_attach`'s lock ordering) and because the
/// resize channel is sized at `DEFAULT_INPUT_MAILBOX = 64`, which is
/// well above the worst-case number of panes per attach (1 today; would
/// stay << 64 even with multi-window sessions).
///
/// The `pane.dims` update is wrapped in `with_mut` once so the registry
/// stays consistent with what future `TERMINAL_SNAPSHOT` payloads will
/// report; the resize sends are emitted while holding the same lock,
/// matching `handle_viewport_resize`'s pattern (the actor's mailbox is
/// independent of the state lock).
