//! Hub-to-satellite frame relay (phux-v45.4, ADR-0007 §4).
//!
//! The routing layer that replaces the blanket `UnsupportedSatelliteRoute`
//! rejections on a `phux server --hub`: a frame targeting
//! `TerminalId::Satellite { host, id }` is resolved to the live outbound
//! link the dialer (phux-v45.3) maintains for `host`, its terminal id is
//! rewritten to `Local { id }`, and the frame is forwarded **verbatim** —
//! the hub never re-encodes VT bytes (ADR-0007: opaque relay). Responses
//! and subscribed streams coming back from the satellite are re-tagged
//! `Local { id }` -> `Satellite { host, id }` before they reach the
//! consumer, so the consumer only ever sees the hub-scoped address it
//! asked for. Satellites stay unaware of each other: a frame arriving
//! from a satellite already tagged `Satellite` is dropped, never chained.
//!
//! One `RelaySession` lives inside each link supervisor
//! (`super::link::run_link`) while its connection is up. It owns the
//! per-link `request_id` remap (the hub allocates its own id space toward
//! the satellite; the consumer's `request_id` never crosses the link) and
//! the proxy-subscription registry (which hub consumers observe which
//! satellite terminals). Consumers talk to it through a `RelayHandle` —
//! a bounded mailbox published in `HubRelays` on shared state.
//!
//! **Fail fast, never hang.** No live connection means a typed
//! `ErrorCode::SatelliteUnreachable` reply, immediately: the link
//! supervisor drains the relay mailbox during dial, backoff, and
//! fail-closed refusal phases, failing every queued request. A satellite
//! disconnect fails all in-flight commands the same way and pushes one
//! typed `ERROR { SatelliteUnreachable }` frame to every proxy-subscribed
//! consumer before the registry is cleared — teardown is observable, not
//! silence. A *silently* dead satellite — one whose link still looks
//! `Connected` because the network partitioned without FIN/RST, or one
//! that reads frames but never answers — is bounded twice over: every
//! relayed command carries a hub-side deadline (`RELAY_COMMAND_TIMEOUT`)
//! resolving to the same typed error, and the link supervisor enforces a
//! transport keepalive / idle contract (`super::link`) so the partition
//! itself is detected and torn down. Abandoned entries in the
//! pending-command map are pruned on the supervisor's keepalive tick
//! (`RelaySession::prune_abandoned`), so a satellite that swallows
//! frames cannot grow hub state without bound.
//!
//! **Backpressure.** The relay mailbox is bounded (`RELAY_MAILBOX`) and
//! every producer uses `try_send`: a saturated link fails commands with
//! `ResourceExhausted` and drops fire-and-forget frames with a warn,
//! mirroring the pane-input mailbox semantics. Return-leg fan-out to
//! consumers uses `try_send` into each consumer's bounded outbound
//! mailbox (the same discipline as `crate::runtime::client::broadcast_event`),
//! so one slow consumer never stalls the link or the hub's other work.
//! The one exception is the attach ordering anchor (phux-v45.12, L1 §9.1):
//! a return-leg `TERMINAL_SNAPSHOT` a briefly-full consumer refuses is
//! *retained* per subscriber and that consumer's later deltas are
//! suppressed until it lands, so a `TERMINAL_OUTPUT` can never overtake the
//! snapshot across the two-hop attach — the non-blocking mirror of the
//! local attach's snapshot gate (`RelaySession::fan_out` /
//! `flush_pending_snapshots`). Still no head-of-line stall: the retry is
//! per-consumer, not a link-wide await.
