//! Hub outbound link supervisor (phux-v45.3/v45.9, ADR-0007/ADR-0038).
//!
//! Under `phux server --hub`, each enabled [`HubEntry`] gets one link
//! supervisor task (`run_link`, crate-internal) that dials the satellite through the
//! shared `phux-dial` stack and authenticates **exactly like a remote
//! consumer** (ADR-0038): TLS 1.3 with the satellite's leaf certificate
//! pinned by SHA-256 fingerprint, plus the pairing bearer token — a
//! length-prefixed stream preamble on QUIC, an `Authorization: Bearer`
//! header on WebSocket. The token is re-read from its file on every
//! attempt, so rotating it never needs a hub restart.
//!
//! **SSH-stdio** (`ssh://`, phux-v45.9) is the third dial path: the hub
//! spawns the system `ssh` binary (override with `$PHUX_SSH`) running
//! the remote `phux stdio-bridge` verb, which splices its stdin/stdout
//! to the satellite server's local Unix socket. SSH itself
//! authenticates and encrypts the channel, and the remote bridge
//! inherits the satellite UDS's local (owner-only) trust, so **no
//! bearer preamble is sent** and a registry `token-file` /
//! `cert-fingerprint` on an `ssh://` entry is ignored (there is no TLS
//! channel to pin) — see the ADR-0038 addendum. The child is spawned
//! with `BatchMode=yes` (never an interactive prompt) and argv built
//! from charset-validated parts (no shell, `--` before the host);
//! "connected" means the ssh child is running — the first authoritative
//! liveness signal is the child's exit, which redials like a dropped
//! connection.
//!
//! **Fail closed.** [`plan_link`] refuses to dial a routable endpoint
//! whose entry lacks a token file or fingerprint pin (and refuses
//! plaintext `ws://` to routable hosts outright), mirroring
//! `phux attach --quic/--ws`. Loopback endpoints keep the loopback dev
//! carve-out. A refused link is never dialed and never retried — the
//! refusal is a configuration error, surfaced as
//! [`LinkStatus::Refused`] and fixed by `phux satellite add`. Malformed
//! `ssh://` endpoints fail earlier still, at hub-table validation.
//!
//! A lost or failed link is re-dialed with capped exponential backoff;
//! per-satellite state is published to [`HubLinkStatuses`], the shared
//! handle a future `LIST` aggregation (phux-v45.5) reads.
//!
//! While a link is up, the supervisor drives that satellite's
//! `super::relay::RelaySession` (phux-v45.4): consumer requests arrive
//! on the per-satellite relay mailbox and are framed onto the connection;
//! inbound frames resolve relayed replies and fan re-tagged streams out
//! to proxy-subscribed consumers. While the link is *down* (dialing,
//! backoff, fail-closed refusal) the supervisor keeps draining the
//! mailbox, failing every request fast with a typed
//! `SatelliteUnreachable` — a consumer never hangs on a dead satellite.
//!
//! A dead satellite that *looks* up is handled too: every link enforces a
//! keepalive / idle contract. QUIC gets it from the transport (`phux-dial`
//! sets `keep_alive_interval` + `max_idle_timeout`; expiry surfaces as a
//! read error). WebSocket has no transport-level idle detection, so the
//! supervisor originates pings on `LINK_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL` and tears
//! the link down when nothing (not even a pong) has arrived within
//! `LINK_IDLE_TIMEOUT` — a silent partition becomes an ordinary
//! disconnect: session teardown, typed errors, redial. Wire writes are
//! bounded by `LINK_SEND_TIMEOUT` so a peer with full socket buffers
//! cannot wedge the supervisor loop, and the keepalive tick doubles as
//! the sweep that prunes relayed commands whose consumer stopped waiting.
