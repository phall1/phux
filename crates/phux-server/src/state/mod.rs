#![allow(clippy::nursery)]
//! Server-side state shared by the listener loop and per-client tasks
//! (`phux-byc.4`).
//!
//! This module owns:
//!
//! * The [`Registry`] of sessions, windows, and panes (the canonical
//!   domain state from `phux-byc.1`/`phux-byc.2`).
//! * The set of currently attached clients ([`AttachedClient`]) keyed by a
//!   server-assigned monotonic [`ClientId`].
//! * The list of subscribers per pane — used to fan diffs out to every client
//!   that is currently observing a pane.
//!
//! Client input is not buffered here: [`TerminalInput`] events flow directly
//! onto the per-pane [`crate::terminal_actor::TerminalActor`]'s input mailbox,
//! which encodes them to PTY bytes (see `runtime::commands`).
//!
//! # Concurrency model
//!
//! The server runs on a `tokio::runtime::Builder::new_current_thread`
//! executor (see `runtime.rs`, ADR-0003 "one server per user, one event
//! loop"). Per-client tasks are spawned via `tokio::task::spawn_local`
//! onto a [`tokio::task::LocalSet`] (per ADR-0014), so per-client
//! futures are `!Send` and can hold `Rc<RefCell<_>>` if desired.
//!
//! [`ServerState`] itself stays behind `Arc<Mutex<_>>` because the
//! [`crate::terminal_actor::TerminalHandle`] held inside `panes` is `Send` and
//! the surrounding [`SharedState`] is used in a few sync contexts
//! (pre-seed before `LocalSet` entry, test scaffolding). Critical sections
//! are short (microseconds: a few `HashMap` ops), so atomic contention
//! is not a concern in steady state. The `std::sync::Mutex` avoids
//! `tokio::sync::Mutex`'s async-friendly futures-park machinery because
//! every section in this module is sync and finite — we never `.await`
//! while holding it.
