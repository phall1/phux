/// encoder correctly emits CSI-u sequences (e.g. `\x1b[113;1u` for `q`).

/// CSI-u (validated in `tests/htop_keys.rs`). The encoder's terminal-
/// state awareness is unchanged; only the default advertisement is.
///
/// Trade-off: phux loses ghostty-specific terminfo extensions (sixel,
/// kitty graphics caps as advertised by terminfo, the ghostty-specific
/// SGR colour extensions). Those features are still reachable when the
/// app opts in directly. When phux's own input/output layer fully
/// supports the kitty keyboard protocol round-trip, revert this to
