//! Per-pane actor (`phux-byc.5`).
//!
//! Owns a `libghostty_vt::Terminal`, a backing `portable_pty` master,
//! and per-pane input encoders. Drives a `select!` loop that forwards
//! PTY output to subscribed clients and writes client-originated input
//! back to the PTY.
//!
//! See ADR-0014 for the placement rationale. In short: `Terminal` is
//! `!Send + !Sync`, so it can't live behind a `tokio::spawn` future. It
//! lives inside a `spawn_local` task that runs on the server's existing
//! current-thread runtime via a `LocalSet`. All cross-task coordination
//! flows through channel handles ([`TerminalHandle`]) that are `Send` —
//! the actor itself never crosses a thread boundary.
//!
//! # PTY async wrapper choice
//!
//! `portable_pty::MasterPty::try_clone_reader` / `take_writer` hand out
//! `Box<dyn Read + Send>` and `Box<dyn Write + Send>` — both **blocking**
//! I/O handles. We bridge them to async with two dedicated `std::thread`s
//! (one for reads, one for writes) that talk to the actor over
//! `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels. This avoids OS-specific `AsyncFd`
//! plumbing for a feature whose value (a few PTY fds, not hundreds)
//! doesn't justify the complexity. At typical phux pane counts (1–20)
//! the per-pane thread cost is invisible against everything else the
//! server does.
//!
//! # Why `bytes::Bytes` for the output broadcast
//!
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender` requires `Clone` payloads (every
//! subscriber receives a copy of the same value). `bytes::Bytes` is the
//! standard cheap-clone byte buffer in the tokio ecosystem; `Vec<u8>`
//! would also work but at the cost of a full clone per subscriber.
