//! Authority over the `phux.agent/v1` record (ADR-0046 §E).
//!
//! Two writers can reach one Terminal's record: a human/agent/plugin issuing
//! an explicit `SET_METADATA`, and the server-side detector. They must not
//! fight over it. The arbitration rule, normatively:
//!
//! > An explicit `SET_METADATA` on `phux.agent/v1` that supplies a `state`
//! > outranks the detector; the detector makes no further writes to that
//! > Terminal until the record is `DELETE`d. An explicit write that supplies
//! > only identity (`name` / `kind` / `session`) is preserved field-for-field
//! > and the detector fills `state` around it. The detector deletes only
//! > records it itself wrote.
//!
//! The declaration cannot be inferred from the stored bytes. The client's
//! `AgentMetaState` decodes an absent or unrecognized `state` to `Unknown`,
//! so `unknown` and "absent" are indistinguishable on the way back out — and
//! the detector's own writes carry a `state` too. So declaration is tracked
//! explicitly, populated ONLY from the `SET_METADATA` entry point. The
//! detector's drain writes through `ServerState::metadata_set` directly and
//! therefore never passes through it, which is exactly what makes the
//! bookkeeping honest.
