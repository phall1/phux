//! Selection extraction: turn a [`Match`] coordinate span into the text under
//! it, via libghostty's sound one-shot selection-format API.
//!
//! # Why this exists (`phux-3sy` / `phux-97w`, the unblocked bridge)
//!
//! [`search`](crate::search) locates a literal needle in the rows phux
//! already mirrors and returns a [`Match`]: a [`Region`] plus a `row` and a
//! `col`/`len` span measured in `char` offsets into the *right-trimmed
//! projected text row* (the exact `String` rows
//! [`screen_state_with_scrollback`](crate::grid::SnapshotSynthesizer::screen_state_with_scrollback)
//! builds). That is the search layer's coordinate space, not libghostty's.
//!
//! This module is the copy/extract primitive the selection/copy-mode epic
//! (`phux-abi`) needs: it converts that `(Region, row, char-col, len)` span
//! into a [`libghostty_vt::selection::Selection`] over the terminal's grid
//! and formats just that range back to plain text via the sound one-shot
//! The `Terminal::format_selection_alloc` path. It is deliberately *only* the
//! find-coords -> selection -> text extraction primitive: no copy-mode UI,
//! no cursor, no highlight.
//!
//! # The wide-glyph translation (the crux, 3sy's caveat)
//!
//! A `char` offset into the trimmed text row diverges from a grid column
//! whenever the row holds wide glyphs (CJK / emoji) or multi-`char` grapheme
//! clusters (a base codepoint plus combining marks). The projection (see
//! [`screen_state_with_scrollback`](crate::grid::SnapshotSynthesizer::screen_state_with_scrollback))
//! builds each row by
//! walking cells in grid order, skipping [`CellWide::SpacerTail`] cells (the
//! right half of a wide glyph emits no column), pushing each cell's whole
//! grapheme cluster as one-or-more `char`s, and advancing the grid column by
//! the cell's display width (2 for [`CellWide::Wide`], else 1). For example,
//! the row `你好xy` occupies grid columns 0 (wide `你`), 1 (its skipped
//! tail), 2 (wide `好`), 3 (its tail), 4 (`x`), 5 (`y`); its trimmed text is
//! the 4-`char` string `你好xy` whose char offsets 0,1,2,3 map to grid
//! columns 0,2,4,5.
//!
//! The private `char_col_to_grid_x` re-walks the same cells in the same order
//! to invert that mapping: given a target `char` offset it returns the grid column of
//! the cell that *contains* that offset. Mapping the cell's *left edge* is
//! correct for a wide glyph — a selection endpoint on the wide base covers
//! the whole glyph, and libghostty's `SpacerTail` is not independently
//! selectable.
//!
//! # Point space
//!
//! A [`Region::Viewport`] match maps to [`Point::Active`] coordinates (the
//! viewport walk projects active-area rows top-first, `y = row`).
//!
//! A [`Region::Scrollback`] match maps to [`Point::History`] coordinates. The
//! search layer reports the history `row` oldest-first into the *projected
//! window* it searched, which is the full retained history for
//! [`Scope::AllHistory`] and the most-recent slice for
//! [`Scope::RecentHistory`]. That window offset is one-to-one with an absolute
//! [`Point::History`] `y` once the [`Scope`] (and the live retained-row count)
//! are known, so [`extract_match_in_scope`] threads the scope and resolves it;
//! the scope-free [`extract_match`] rejects a scrollback match with
//! [`ExtractError::ScrollbackNeedsScope`] rather than guessing. The history and
//! viewport walks share one point-space-generic cell walk, so the
//! wide-glyph / combining-mark `char`-col-to-grid-col inversion is identical in
//! both.
