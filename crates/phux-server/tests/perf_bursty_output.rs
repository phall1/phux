//! Bursty-output allocation gate (wave-fix/perf-bursty-output).
//!
//! Heavy, rapidly-repainting COLORED terminal output (zsh completion
//! menus, syntax-highlighted output, anything that churns every row with
//! lots of SGR) used to stutter the attached session. The dominant
//! server-side cost was the per-consumer state-sync diff
//! ([`SnapshotSynthesizer::synthesize_against_reference`]): it allocated a
//! fresh `Vec<u8>` per row every tick AND, inside the cell walk,
//! `CellIteration::graphemes()` allocated a `Vec<char>` for *every cell*
//! (`vec!['\0'; len]`). On an 80x40 grid under full churn that was ~2000
//! heap allocations per tick — pure churn the GC-less hot path paid on
//! every 33 Hz tick, per consumer.
//!
//! The fix renders each row into a reused scratch buffer (swapped into the
//! reference's stored body so the displaced allocation becomes the next
//! row's scratch) and reads grapheme clusters into a stack buffer via
//! `graphemes_len` + `graphemes_buf`. Steady-state churn now allocates
//! only the per-frame output `Vec` plus a small, bounded constant.
//!
//! This test asserts a hard per-tick allocation ceiling well below the
//! pre-fix figure so a regression (e.g. reintroducing `graphemes()` or a
//! per-row `Vec`) trips CI. It is a coarse architectural gate, not a
//! microbenchmark: the bound has generous headroom over the measured
//! steady-state (~48 allocs/tick for 40 rows) so it is not flaky across
//! allocator/std differences.
