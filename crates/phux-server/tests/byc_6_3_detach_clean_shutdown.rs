//! `phux-byc.6.3` — `detach_clean_shutdown`.
//!
//! Wire-level integration test for the DETACH path. Drives a real
//! `ServerRuntime` over a Unix-domain socket, exercises the full
//! attach -> detach lifecycle, and verifies that the server cleans
//! up per-client state cleanly enough that a *fresh* client can
//! re-attach to the same session without any stale residue.
//!
//! Coverage matrix (mapped to SPEC §7.3 and the byc.6.3 ticket):
//!
//! 1. After ATTACH the server emits ATTACHED + `PANE_SNAPSHOT` as usual.
//! 2. Client sends DETACH; server replies with DETACHED.
//! 3. Client drops the stream; server observes EOF cleanly (no
//!    `client task ended with error` log line — proven indirectly by
//!    the next step succeeding).
//! 4. A *fresh* client connects, sends ATTACH, and gets a NEW
//!    ATTACHED whose `initial_client_id` is strictly greater than
//!    the first attach's id. Monotonic `ClientId` allocation
//!    (`ServerState::new_client_id`) means a re-issued id would
//!    indicate the registry was clobbered — distinct ids prove
//!    fresh-client cleanly attached to a still-intact session.
//! 5. The re-attaching client also gets a `PANE_SNAPSHOT` — the
//!    pane actor survived the detach and is still serving snapshots.
//!
//! The byc.6.3 ticket asks us to verify the wire-level mirror of the
//! `ServerState::detach_removes_client_and_drops_empty_subscriber_lists`
//! unit test. We do not (and cannot) reach into `ServerState` from an
//! integration binary; instead we exercise the same invariant
//! externally: if `detach` failed to drop the outbound mailbox or the
//! `pane_subscribers` entry, the second attach would either hang
//! waiting for a slot or see corrupted snapshot state. Neither
//! happens here.
