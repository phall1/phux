//! `phux-fysb` regression — re-attaching to a MULTI-PANE session must let
//! the re-attached client type into EVERY pane, not just the active one.
//!
//! The bug: `ServerState::attach` used to subscribe the attaching client to
//! only the session's ACTIVE pane. The input gate in `handle_terminal_input`
//! DROPS any `INPUT_KEY` for a pane the client isn't subscribed to ("client
//! not subscribed to pane; dropping input"). So on (re-)attach to a session
//! with more than one pane, the client could see every pane's prompt but
//! could only type into the active one — a freshly spawned pane worked solely
//! because `handle_spawn_terminal` auto-subscribes the spawner. The user hit
//! this as "still can't type after re-attach" once the off-loop-writer fix
//! (`#51`) made the panes render again.
//!
//! The fix subscribes the attaching client to every pane across all the
//! session's windows. This pins it at the wire level, the way the user hits
//! it — the previous coverage was a `ServerState` unit test only, and the fix
//! was nearly lost in the `state.rs` module-split refactor.
//!
//! Shape:
//!
//! 1. Seed a session whose pane runs `cat` (cooked-mode echo = crisp signal).
//! 2. Client A attaches and `SPAWN_TERMINAL`s a second `cat` pane into the
//!    same session, then drops — leaving a persisted two-pane session.
//! 3. Client B attaches fresh (the re-attach). With the fix it is subscribed
//!    to BOTH panes.
//! 4. A side observer (never attached; `GET_STATE`/`GET_SCREEN` are
//!    side-effect-free and unsubscribed) resolves the focused (active) pane
//!    and the non-active one.
//! 5. B `INPUT_KEY`s into the active pane (baseline: input delivery works at
//!    all) and into the NON-active pane (the regression guard). The observer
//!    reads each pane's mirror via `GET_SCREEN` and both echoes must land —
//!    reading the mirror, not B's own output stream, isolates "the keystroke
//!    reached the PTY" from "B happens to be subscribed to output".
//!
//! Without the fix the non-active keystroke is dropped, its echo never reaches
//! the pane mirror, and the second assertion fails.
