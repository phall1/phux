//! Replay-equivalence property tests for the pane output stream (phux-r4k).
//!
//! The server brings a fresh consumer up to date with a snapshot
//! (`vt_replay_bytes`, served by `SnapshotRequest`) and thereafter forwards
//! every PTY byte over the `TERMINAL_OUTPUT` broadcast. An audit established
//! the broadcast stream is *complete* (no dropped bytes on the happy path),
//! but nothing asserted the stronger *totality* property these two channels
//! are supposed to jointly guarantee:
//!
//!   For a consumer that captures a snapshot `S0` and then applies every
//!   byte the server broadcasts afterwards, the reconstructed grid is equal
//!   to the server's own authoritative grid at that later instant.
//!
//! We pin that down by comparing two libghostty grids, line for line:
//!
//!   * the consumer's reconstruction: `S0.bytes ++ broadcast-tail`, replayed
//!     into a fresh `Terminal` (via the `Screen` oracle), and
//!   * the server's authority: a *fresh* snapshot `S1` taken once the stream
//!     has settled (`S1` IS the server's serialized grid right then).
//!
//! # Ordering contract this relies on (see `terminal_actor.rs::run`)
//!
//! The actor is a single `biased` `select!` loop on one task. The PTY arm
//! writes a chunk to the `Terminal` and broadcasts that same chunk, from the
//! *same* arm, with no interleaving against the snapshot arm. A
//! `SnapshotRequest` is served in a different arm by walking the live
//! `Terminal`. There is no sequence number tying a snapshot to a position in
//! the broadcast stream; the only ordering is the causal serialization of the
//! loop. So "capture S0, then everything after it" must avoid both an overlap
//! (a chunk already in S0 that we also replay) and a gap (a chunk in S1 that we
//! never collected).
//!
//! We make that race-free with a *deterministic, single-shot* producer rather
//! than `cat`'s cooked-mode double echo (whose line-discipline echo and stdout
//! echo arrive as separate chunks with load-dependent timing — that is exactly
//! what makes a naive `cat`-based version flaky). The pane runs a shell that
//! blocks on `read`, and each newline we send releases one `printf` of a fixed,
//! self-positioning block emitted in a single write:
//!
//!   * S0 is taken *before* any block is released, so the stream is empty at S0
//!     and there is nothing to reconcile — no overlap.
//!   * Each block ends in a unique sentinel token; we collect the broadcast
//!     until the sentinel of the *last* block appears, so the full stream up to
//!     S1 is captured — no gap. Because each block is one atomic `printf`, the
//!     sentinel appears exactly once, eliminating the "stopped at the first of
//!     two echoes" hazard.
//!
//! Blocks position themselves with `\r\n` so the only input echo in the stream
//! (the newline released to `read`) is a cursor move that lands identically in
//! both the server grid and the reconstruction.
