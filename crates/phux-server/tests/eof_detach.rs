//! Wire-level integration test for the PTY-EOF → `TERMINAL_CLOSED` path
//! (`phux-it8`, reshaped by `phux-4r1`).
//!
//! Reproduces the user-visible "type `exit` in the inner shell and the
//! client freezes forever in alt-screen" bug. Before the original fix,
//! the `TerminalActor`'s EOF branch just dropped its PTY receiver and
//! kept the actor alive "for snapshot/input drain" — but neither the
//! runtime nor any attached client got told the pane was dead, so the
//! client sat in its `tokio::select!` waiting for frames that never came.
//!
//! `phux-it8` first closed that hole by having the server send
//! `FrameKind::Detached` on EOF. `phux-4r1` then reshaped that EOF
//! signal into the L1 lifecycle event `FrameKind::TerminalClosed`
//! (ADR-0015 L1): the server now reports the *fact* that the PTY exited
//! (carrying its exit status) and stops deciding detach. The
//! "no Terminals left in my collection ⇒ detach" policy moved out of
//! the server runtime and into the TUI consumer (`attach::driver`).
//!
//! This test pins down the server half of that contract from the wire's
//! point of view: pre-seed with a shell that exits promptly, attach a
//! client, and assert a `TERMINAL_CLOSED { exit_status: Some(0) }` frame
//! arrives within a generous two-second deadline. The server MUST NOT
//! send `DETACHED` on EOF anymore.
