//! Wire-level integration test for the `AgentEvent::Asked` stream
//! (SPEC §7.5, ADR-0022 'events', `phux-2sl6`).
//!
//! `Asked` is the control-plane carrier for a pending human-answerable
//! question: an in-pane agent that has blocked for input signals it, and a
//! subscriber on the `EVENT` stream receives the question (id, text,
//! suggested answers) without re-deriving it from the grid. This test pins
//! the server half of that contract from the wire's point of view:
//!
//! 1. Pre-seed a PTY-backed pane with a shell that, after a short delay (so
//!    the client wins the race to subscribe), sets its terminal title via
//!    OSC 2 to a `phux-ask` sentinel, then idles so the marker stays set.
//! 2. Attach a client and `SUBSCRIBE_EVENTS { terminal: None }`
//!    (server-wide).
//! 3. Assert an `Asked` event arrives carrying the parsed id, question, and
//!    suggestion list.
//!
//! v1 ask-trigger is OSC-driven. libghostty-vt does not surface OSC 9 / OSC
//! 777 desktop-notification escapes through its Rust API — title (OSC 0/2),
//! pwd (OSC 7), and bell are the only user-notification signals it exposes —
//! so an agent signals a pending ask by setting its title to a `phux-ask`
//! sentinel. Full agent-state detection (manifests / hooks / OSC-9
//! surfacing) is the follow-up phux-2sl6.4.
//!
//! The leading sleep is the same race-avoidance trick `agent_events.rs`
//! uses: the event stream is a best-effort accelerator, so a marker set
//! before the subscription lands is legitimately dropped; the seed defers
//! its observable output until the client has subscribed.
