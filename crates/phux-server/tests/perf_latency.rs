//! Wall-clock latency gate (e2e flywheel item 3).
//!
//! The existing perf gate ([`perf_bursty_output`]) counts *allocations*
//! per synthesis tick — a regression detector for the diff hot path. This
//! is its wall-clock sibling: it drives a representative burst against the
//! REAL server over the wire and asserts the end-to-end time from input to
//! screen-settle stays under a generous ceiling. Same philosophy as the
//! alloc gate: a coarse regression tripwire, not a microbenchmark. The
//! ceiling has wide headroom over the measured time on this machine so it
//! is not flaky across allocator/scheduler differences and under the
//! contended nextest pool.
//!
//! Two scenarios:
//!   1. Heavy colored output (the bursty-output repro shape) drained to
//!      settle on a single client.
//!   2. A 2-client attach: both clients converge on the same burst, and
//!      the slower client's time-to-settle is gated (the fanout must not
//!      starve a second subscriber).
//!
//! `time-to-settle` is measured by [`ClientHandle::converge`]: the
//! duration from the first drained byte to the screen going idle for the
//! convergence window. It captures input→render→settle, the latency a
//! user actually feels.
