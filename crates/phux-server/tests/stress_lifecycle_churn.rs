//! Lifecycle-churn adversarial stress (crash-hunt wave).
//!
//! Companion to `stress_attach_churn`. Where that test churns a single
//! transient client against a stable pane, this one drives the harder
//! lifecycle edges the user's "lags/crashes in edge cases" report points
//! at:
//!
//!   * MANY concurrent clients (up to 10) attached at once while output
//!     flows, then detached in a churned order — exercises the
//!     per-consumer reference grid + the detach reaping under fan-out.
//!   * Rapid attach/detach cycling on one pane during sustained output —
//!     dozens of connect/teardown cycles a second.
//!   * Attach RIGHT as the pane's PTY EOFs (mid-teardown): a client racing
//!     a session that is reaping itself must get either a clean snapshot
//!     or a clean error/EOF, never a panic.
//!
//! All scenarios assert NO panic (a panicked actor/connection task surfaces
//! as a wire hang → `wait_until` timeout, or as the `run_async` error the
//! harness teardown unwraps) and a coherent end state. Heavy `just e2e`
//! lane only.
