//! Attach/detach-churn stress test (e2e flywheel item 6).
//!
//! Models a flaky client (or a fleet of short-lived agents) repeatedly
//! attaching and dropping against a live session. The server must reap
//! each connection cleanly, keep the underlying pane alive across the
//! churn, and serve a correct snapshot to every fresh client. The failure
//! modes this guards against: a `ClientId` slot leak, a per-pane
//! subscriber list that grows without bound (broadcast capacity
//! eviction), or a panic during connection teardown.
//!
//! Built on [`E2eBuilder`] / [`Harness`]: one long-lived "anchor" client
//! holds the session open while a churn loop attaches a transient client,
//! observes the live pane via the snapshot, then drops it — repeatedly.
//! A unique marker printed once by the seed pane is asserted visible on
//! each fresh attach (the snapshot still reconstructs the grid after
//! churn) and on the anchor at the end (the pane survived).
