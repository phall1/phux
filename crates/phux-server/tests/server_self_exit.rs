//! Lifecycle integration tests for the tmux server-exit model (phux-60s)
//! and its auto-spawn grace (phux-k61 follow-up).
//!
//! Contract: when a pane's process exits, the runtime reaps the pane,
//! cascading to its window and session. Once the last session is gone the
//! server self-exits — **but only after it has served at least one
//! client**. A freshly auto-spawned server whose seed pane dies before
//! anyone attaches must stay alive (empty) so the launching `phux` can
//! still connect and repopulate it; otherwise the auto-spawn → attach
//! flow races the server's own self-exit and the user sees "no server".
