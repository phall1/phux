//! Heavy-colored-output wall-clock latency gate (e2e flywheel).
//!
//! This is the regression detector for the user's actual symptom: a
//! zsh-completion-menu / syntax-highlight burst — many full-width
//! SGR-laden rows rewritten every frame — stuttering the attached
//! session. [`perf_bursty_output`] gates the *allocation* cost of the
//! per-consumer diff on that shape; [`perf_latency`] gates the wall-clock
//! settle of a moderately-colored burst. This gate is the dedicated
//! wall-clock sibling for the WORST-case colored shape: an SGR change
//! roughly every other column (built by
//! [`common::builder::colored_burst_command`]), driven against the REAL
//! server over the wire, with the client-applied result captured by the
//! libghostty [`Screen`] oracle.
//!
//! Same philosophy as the sibling gates: a coarse regression tripwire,
//! not a microbenchmark. Two assertions, both with documented headroom:
//!
//!   1. `time-to-settle` (first drained byte → screen idle) under a
//!      generous ceiling. A real regression (the per-consumer diff going
//!      quadratic on SGR runs, the broadcast pump stalling, the client's
//!      VT apply or per-cell render regressing) blows past it.
//!   2. Per-frame cost: settle / observed-repaints stays under a
//!      per-frame ceiling. This catches a regression that keeps the total
//!      under the wall-clock ceiling only because the burst happened to be
//!      short — it normalizes by the number of repaints actually drained.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d into the `just e2e` lane: like the other real-PTY gates it
//! spawns a real server + PTY and asserts on load-sensitive timing, which
//! starves and trips under the full-parallel `just test` pool. Run it one
//! binary at a time via `just e2e`.
