//! `phux-eb0` — in-process session re-attach over one connection.
//!
//! Wire-level proof of the contract the client's outer re-attach loop
//! depends on (`phux-client::attach::driver::run_with_stdout_predict`):
//! a single client connection can ATTACH to session A, DETACH, and then
//! ATTACH to a DIFFERENT session B **on the same transport connection**,
//! receiving B's ATTACHED snapshot + a fresh `TERMINAL_SNAPSHOT` for B's
//! seed pane.
//!
//! The client side tears down all session-scoped state and re-runs the
//! handshake between the DETACH and the second ATTACH; this test pins the
//! server-side half: that DETACH frees the per-consumer state without
//! closing the connection (so the same socket is reusable) and that the
//! re-ATTACH resolves a different session and snapshots its panes. If the
//! server closed the connection on DETACH, or refused a second ATTACH on
//! a connection that had already attached, the client's flicker-free
//! in-process switch would be impossible and this test would fail.
//!
//! Distinguishing A from B: the two sessions have distinct names and
//! distinct seed-pane `TerminalId`s, so the second ATTACHED's snapshot
//! (focused session name + focused pane id) must differ from the first.
