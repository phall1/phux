//! Shared outbound dialer for phux remote transports.
//!
//! Both remote *consumers* (`phux attach --quic/--ws`, the phux-client
//! attach loop) and the federation *hub* (`phux server --hub`, which dials
//! its satellites per ADR-0007/ADR-0038) establish connections the same
//! way: TLS 1.3 with the server's self-signed leaf certificate pinned by
//! SHA-256 fingerprint (or a loopback dev skip), plus an ADR-0031 bearer
//! token — a length-prefixed stream preamble on QUIC, an
//! `Authorization: Bearer` header on WebSocket.
//!
//! This crate is that shared establishment layer, factored out of
//! `phux-client::attach` so `phux-server`'s hub dialer (phux-v45.3) reuses
//! the identical, tested stack instead of duplicating security-sensitive
//! code. It deliberately stops at the byte stream: SPEC §5 framing and the
//! attach lifecycle stay with the callers (`phux-client::attach::connection`
//! and the server's hub link supervisor), preserving ADR-0007's
//! transport-trait shape — transports differ only below the framed
//! reader/writer seam.
//!
//! No wire bytes are defined here; the crate moves opaque streams and the
//! auth preamble ADR-0031 already specifies.
