//! Canonical action registry (phux-ahv.8).
//!
//! The fuzzy commands-and-help finder needs a human-facing catalogue of the
//! actions the dispatcher can run. That catalogue must
//! not drift from what [`run_action`](super::input_dispatch) actually
//! handles — a palette entry for an action the dispatcher ignores is a
//! dead command, and an action the dispatcher handles but the palette
//! omits is undiscoverable.
//!
//! ## Drift prevention
//!
//! There is one source of truth for the set of action *names*:
//! [`ACTION_NAMES`](super::input_dispatch::ACTION_NAMES), owned next to
//! `run_action`. This module's [`REGISTRY`] supplies the *presentation*
//! (description + the default [`ResolvedAction`] the palette commits) for
//! each of those names; [`NON_PALETTE_ACTIONS`] documents the remainder —
//! actions the dispatcher handles but the palette deliberately omits, each
//! with the reason. A unit test (`every_action_has_exactly_one_doc_home`)
//! asserts the two consts partition `ACTION_NAMES` exactly, so adding an
//! arm to `run_action` without documenting it — or vice versa — fails CI.
//! Adding a new action is therefore a three-touch change that the compiler
//! and the test funnel together: the `run_action` match arm, the
//! `ACTION_NAMES` entry, and the [`REGISTRY`] row (or
//! [`NON_PALETTE_ACTIONS`] entry). The generated reference page
//! `docs/reference/actions.md` renders from the union (see
//! `phux::refdocs::actions`), so the same funnel keeps the docs complete.
//!
//! Palette items resolve their *bound chord* at build time from the live
//! [`KeybindingsCfg`] snapshot, so the displayed shortcut always reflects
//! the user's actual config (or `"unbound"`).
