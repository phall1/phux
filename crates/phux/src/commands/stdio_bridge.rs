//! `phux stdio-bridge` — splice stdin/stdout to the local server socket.
//!
//! The remote end of the SSH-stdio transport (ADR-0007, phux-v45.9): a
//! federation hub (or any remote consumer) runs
//! `ssh HOST phux stdio-bridge` and the wire protocol flows over the ssh
//! channel, through this process, into the phux server's Unix socket on
//! HOST. The bridge is byte-transparent — it never parses, frames, or
//! injects anything, so the peer on stdin/stdout talks to the server
//! exactly as a local UDS client would.
//!
//! Trust: connecting to the UDS makes this process an ordinary local
//! client, guarded by the socket's owner-only permissions
//! (docs/operations.md). The SSH channel above supplies remote
//! authentication and encryption, so no bearer preamble is expected or
//! consumed here (ADR-0038 addendum).
//!
//! stdout carries protocol bytes ONLY. Diagnostics go to stderr, which
//! ssh forwards out-of-band to the dialing side's logs.
