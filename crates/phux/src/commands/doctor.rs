//! `phux doctor` — one command that answers "why isn't this working?".
//!
//! Every check here already existed as its own verb: `config check`,
//! `plugin validate`, a socket-length guard buried in the spawn path, a
//! `GET_STATE` probe inside `ls`, the log-path inventory behind
//! `phux logs`. Knowing to run all of them, in the right order, and how
//! to read each one, is exactly the knowledge a person debugging phux
//! does not have — that is the whole problem. So this composes them and
//! reports one verdict.
//!
//! Two rules keep it honest:
//!
//! * **A check that cannot run is not a check that passed.** Every check
//!   reports [`Status::Warn`] rather than `Pass` when its precondition is
//!   missing, so "no server running" never renders as a green tick.
//! * **Nothing here mutates anything.** A diagnostic that repairs things is
//!   a diagnostic nobody can trust to describe the system.
