//! `phux service` — generate and manage the per-user service unit that keeps
//! a phux server running across logout and reboot (ADR-0055).
//!
//! The naked `phux` path auto-spawns a server when the socket is missing,
//! which covers a cold client but not a cold *host*: a rebooted machine has
//! no server until someone logs in and runs one. This module closes that gap
//! by generating the host's native unit — a `launchd` `LaunchAgent` on macOS, a
//! systemd **user** unit on Linux — with the server's environment
//! materialized into it.
//!
//! The environment wiring is the whole reason this is code rather than a
//! documented snippet. A hand-written unit that omits `PHUX_WS_TOKENS`
//! silently starts a server that rejects every paired device, and the
//! operator discovers it days later from a laptop that will not attach.
//!
//! Scope is per-user by construction (ADR-0003: one server per user). A
//! system-wide `LaunchDaemon` or system systemd unit would imply a multi-user
//! server, which phux does not have.

//
// A unit written before phux-zomb.4 keeps its unthrottled restart-on-any-exit
// policy until something rewrites it. Until now the only "something" was
// `phux service install`, and that is a bad trade for two independent reasons:
//
//   1. It re-renders the unit from a *fresh* `ServicePlan`. `--quic`,
//      `--listen`, `--restore`, `--hub` and `--socket` survive only inside the
//      rendered unit — nothing parses one back — so a blind re-run silently
//      drops the operator's listeners and hub mode.
//   2. It reloads. `launchctl bootout` and `systemctl enable --now` stop the
//      supervised server, and every pane and its in-flight shells, agents and
//      subagents die with it (phux-nvi2).
//
// So the reconcile does neither. It reads the installed file, replaces only
// the keys that carry the restart policy, and leaves every other byte exactly
// where it was — which makes obstacle 1 structurally impossible rather than
// carefully avoided, since the flags are never re-derived at all.

/// What reconciling an installed unit's restart policy would do to it.
