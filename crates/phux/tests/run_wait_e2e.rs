//! Binary-level end-to-end tests for `phux run` and `phux wait` (phux-3rq).
//!
//! Unlike the pure unit tests in `phux-client` (which exercise the
//! sentinel parser and the wait condition in isolation), these drive the
//! REAL `phux` binary — built and handed to us by cargo at
//! `env!("CARGO_BIN_EXE_phux")` — against a REAL PTY-backed server. No
//! tmux, no mocks: a `phux server` child binds a private UDS, and each
//! verb runs as its own subprocess against that socket. They pin the
//! load-bearing process-exit contracts a consumer (an agent, a shell
//! `&&` chain) actually depends on:
//!
//!   * `run` mirrors the command's exit code into the process exit status
//!     (0 for success, 1 for `false`, an arbitrary code for a subshell).
//!   * `run --json` emits the stable `RunResult` contract.
//!   * `wait --until` exits 0 when the marker appears, 124 on timeout.
//!
//! Robustness notes:
//!   * The first server start can be slow (cold caches); we poll for the
//!     socket file with a generous deadline before driving any verb.
//!   * The server child is killed on guard drop, so a panicking assertion
//!     never leaks a daemon.
//!   * `--socket` is passed to EVERY verb so we never touch the user's
//!     real default socket, and the server is never auto-spawned.
//!   * The nonzero-mirror case uses `"(exit 7)"` — a POSIX subshell. This
//!     was verified empirically NOT to kill the session (a bare `exit 7`
//!     would terminate the shell and reap the pane); `phux ls` still
//!     lists the session afterward, and a subsequent `run` succeeds.
