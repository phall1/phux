//! Regression guard for `phux-roz`: the attach loop must not enter the
//! alt screen if it can't even reach the server.
//!
//! Before the `phux-roz` fix, `attach::run` flipped the outer terminal
//! into the alt screen + hid the cursor BEFORE attempting the UDS
//! connect. Any pre-handshake failure (no socket, bogus path, server
//! mid-restart) caused a brief alt-screen flash on success-then-fail
//! and — worse, on SIGTERM mid-connect — left the terminal wedged with
//! the alt-screen and hidden cursor still active.
//!
//! After the fix, [`phux_client::attach::run_with_stdout`] runs the
//! connect / HELLO / ATTACH / ATTACHED-wait sequence on the cooked
//! terminal and only installs the `RawModeGuard` once the server has
//! accepted the attach. This test drives the failure path against a
//! socket path that doesn't exist and asserts that the captured writer
//! received ZERO terminal-control bytes — specifically, no
//! `\x1b[?1049h` (alt-screen-enter) and no `\x1b[?25l` (hide-cursor).
//!
//! The 500ms deadline guards against accidentally introducing a hang
//! (e.g. a future refactor that swallows the connect error and loops).
