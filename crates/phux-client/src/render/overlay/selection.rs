//! The shared copy-mode selection contract (ADR-0045).
//!
//! Copy-mode is a *client-local projection* over the focused pane's own
//! libghostty engine — never a wire tier
//! ([ADR-0030](../../../../../ADR/0030-engine-delegated-wire-and-projection-consumers.md),
//! [ADR-0045](../../../../../ADR/0045-client-side-copy-mode.md)). Two consumers
//! of that projection — the selection UX (`copy_mode`) and the pane renderer
//! (`attach::render`) — must agree, byte for byte, on what a selection is and
//! which cells it covers. This module is the single leaf where that agreement
//! lives: it is **plain data only** and imports neither the overlay state
//! machine, the renderer, ratatui, nor libghostty. Both sides depend on this
//! module; this module depends on neither, so the block-highlight geometry and
//! the copy path can never disagree about what a block selection covers.
//!
//! Everything here was previously scattered across `copy_mode.rs`
//! (`SelectionMode`), `attach/render.rs` (`SelectionRect`), and `overlay/mod.rs`
//! (`SelectionGrab`, `CopyRequest`); ADR-0045 relocates it into one owner.
