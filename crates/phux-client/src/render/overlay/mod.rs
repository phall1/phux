//! Overlay layer — modals, help, command palette.
//!
//! An overlay is a chrome-layer widget that takes over the outer terminal
//! while it's active: input is captured (no keystrokes reach the focused
//! pane's stdin) and pane stdout flushing is paused (per ADR-0020 §Decision
//! invariant 5). Pane libghostty mirrors keep consuming server VT bytes —
//! we only pause the *outbound* flush so the modal doesn't get trampled by
//! a `TERMINAL_OUTPUT` repaint. On dismiss, the driver triggers a full
//! repaint to restore pane content.
//!
//! [`OverlayState`] carries a *stack* of overlays. The top of the stack
//! captures input ([`RenderOverlay::handle_key`]); rendering walks the
//! stack bottom-up so stacked overlays compose (e.g. a command palette
//! painted on top of an open help modal). A single active overlay is the
//! one-element case — the common path is unchanged from a UX standpoint.
//!
//! Submodules:
//! - [`help`] — keybindings reference modal (phux-5ke.4)
//! - [`prompt`] — single-line text-input modal (phux-ahv.1)
//! - [`widgets`] — reusable themed primitives ([`Modal`], [`KeyChordTable`])
//!
//! [`Modal`]: widgets::Modal
//! [`KeyChordTable`]: widgets::KeyChordTable
