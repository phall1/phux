//! One scripted server for every client-side test, so a fake cannot lie
//! about the protocol.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Before it, every module that needed a server stood up its own fake, and
//! each fake encoded what its author *believed* the server does. That is the
//! same belief that produced the bug the test is supposed to catch, so the
//! fake catches nothing. The concrete failure: seventeen `phux rec` unit
//! tests passed against a completely non-functional feature, because the
//! local fake answered `COMMAND_RESULT` *before* the priming bootstrap
//! transcript while the reference server does the opposite. Every capture
//! against a real server came back as a 0x0 grid with nothing playable in it,
//! and the suite was green throughout.
//!
//! The fix is not "write better fakes". It is to have exactly one place
//! where the server's frame *order* is written down — the private
//! `reference_reply` function below — and to make every test route through it.
//!
//! # What is owned here versus supplied by the test
//!
//! The harness owns **order**. A test supplies **payloads**:
//!
//! - the priming snapshot's geometry and replay bytes, but never whether it
//!   precedes the ack (it always does);
//! - the `GET_STATE` snapshot, but never whether a hub's degradation
//!   `ERROR`s precede the ack (they always do);
//! - metadata values, but never their correlation.
//!
//! That split is the whole point: a test can still describe any scenario,
//! and cannot describe an ordering the reference server would not produce.
//!
//! # The orderings encoded, with their reference-server citations
//!
//! - `ATTACH_RESOURCE` — `handle_attach_terminal`
//!   (`crates/phux-server/src/runtime/commands.rs`) pushes the authoritative
//!   bootstrap transcript before the acknowledgement and never re-sends it.
//!   [`ScriptSpec::priming_snapshot`] is therefore **mandatory** for any script
//!   whose client attaches a Terminal: a script without one panics rather than
//!   silently modelling a
//!   server that does not exist.
//! - `GET_STATE` — `handle_get_state_federated` emits one uncorrelated
//!   `ERROR` per unreachable satellite *ahead of* the merged snapshot's ack,
//!   deliberately ("observable degradation, not silence").
//! - `SUBSCRIBE_EVENTS` — `handle_subscribe_events`
//!   (`crates/phux-server/src/runtime/client.rs`) registers the subscription
//!   and sends **no reply at all**. A fake that acked it would teach the
//!   client to wait for a frame that never comes.
//! - `SUBSCRIBE_METADATA` — `handle_subscribe_metadata`
//!   (`crates/phux-server/src/runtime/client.rs`) likewise registers and
//!   replies with nothing, and captures the connection's mailbox so fanout
//!   reaches a consumer that never attached. A script carrying a
//!   `METADATA_CHANGED` therefore waits for *this* frame rather than
//!   `SUBSCRIBE_EVENTS` before it plays.
//! - `HELLO` — answered with `HELLO_OK` echoing this build's
//!   [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`].
//! - `GET_METADATA` / `SET_METADATA` — correlated `METADATA_VALUE` /
//!   `COMMAND_RESULT` on the caller's `request_id`.
//! - `SPAWN_RESOURCE` — `handle_spawn_terminal`
//!   (`crates/phux-server/src/runtime/client.rs`) answers with
//!   `RESOURCE_SPAWNED` on the caller's `request_id`, behind any frames
//!   already queued for the connection. [`ScriptSpec::spawn_result`] is
//!   therefore **mandatory** for a script whose client spawns.
//!   [`ScriptSpec::refuse_spawn`] models the other legal answer: the
//!   correlated `ERROR` a hub surfaces when a satellite refuses the relayed
//!   spawn (`crates/phux-server/src/hub/relay.rs`, `handle_inbound`).
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Deliberately a *client-side* harness: it speaks the server half of a
//! `UnixStream` with [`phux_protocol`]'s codec and nothing else. It is not a
//! second implementation of the server — for behaviour (PTY, layout,
//! federation) the integration tests drive the real `ServerRuntime`. This
//! exists for the unit tests that must not pay for a PTY, and whose only
//! previous alternative was a hand-written fake.
