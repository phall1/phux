//! Stdin VT-byte parsing for the attach loop.
//!
//! The parser turns the byte stream a TTY puts on stdin into structured
//! [`InputEvent`]s aimed at SPEC §9 input frames. It is deliberately small
//! and local — libghostty-vt ships *encoders* (event → bytes) but not a
//! decoder for the reverse direction, so this module hand-rolls just
//! enough of an xterm/VT100 input parser to cover what `phux attach` sees
//! in practice.
//!
//! # Surface area
//!
//! Handled:
//!
//! - Printable ASCII and full UTF-8 multibyte sequences (Unicode keypresses)
//! - C0 controls — CR/LF (Enter), HT (Tab), BS / DEL (Backspace), and the
//!   Ctrl-A..Ctrl-Z encoding (`0x01..=0x1A` minus the dedicated mappings).
//! - **Bare ESC** as the Escape key (see "Timing ambiguity" below).
//! - **ESC + char** as an Alt-modified key (Alt-letter chords).
//! - **CSI** sequences (`ESC [` …) for arrow keys, Home/End/Insert/Delete,
//!   PageUp/PageDown, F-keys via the xterm `CSI 1;<mod>P..S` and VT220
//!   `CSI <n>~` forms, and modifier-bearing variants
//!   (`CSI 1;5A` for Ctrl-Up, `CSI 5;5~` for Ctrl-PageUp, etc.).
//! - **SS3** sequences (`ESC O <P|Q|R|S>`) for the older F1..F4 + numeric
//!   keypad encoding most BSD `termcap` entries still use.
//!
//! Also handled:
//!
//! - **SGR mouse reports** (`CSI < <btn> ; <col> ; <row> M/m`, DEC mode
//!   1006). Emitted as [`InputEvent::Mouse`] with terminal-local cell
//!   coordinates expressed as integer-valued `f64` pixels (per SPEC §9.2.1
//!   the encoder downstream re-quantises for cell-format mouse protocols).
//! - **Legacy X10 mouse** (`CSI M Cb Cx Cy`) — three raw bytes after the
//!   `M` final encode button + position (`Cb = btn + 32`,
//!   `Cx = col + 32`, `Cy = row + 32`). This form cannot be parameterised
//!   as a normal CSI numeric sequence, so the parser drops into a
//!   dedicated 3-byte consumer state (`State::X10Mouse`) when a bare
//!   `CSI M` (empty params) is observed. X10 has no separate release
//!   final byte; releases are signalled by `(Cb & 3) == 3`, which maps
//!   to [`MouseAction::Release`] with [`MouseButton::Unknown`] (matching
//!   the legacy protocol's inability to identify which button was
//!   released).
//! - **urxvt-1015 decimal mouse** (`CSI <btn> ; <col> ; <row> M`). Same
//!   button bitfield as X10 (offset by 32) but with decimal parameters
//!   instead of raw bytes, and always terminated by `M`. Distinguished
//!   from SGR (DEC 1006) by the absence of the leading `<` private-marker.
//! - **Focus reports** (`CSI I` / `CSI O`, DEC mode 1004). Emitted as
//!   [`InputEvent::Focus`].
//! - **Bracketed paste** (`CSI 200~` … `CSI 201~`, DEC mode 2004). The
//!   parser buffers payload bytes between the begin / end markers and
//!   emits a single [`InputEvent::Paste`] at the end-marker. Payload
//!   bytes are passed through verbatim — no nested escape parsing.
//!
//! Not handled (yet):
//!
//! - **Kitty keyboard protocol `CSI u`** sequences — disambiguate-escape
//!   (KIP level 1), event-types including repeat (KIP level 2), and partial
//!   levels 3-5. Sequences of the form
//!   `CSI keycode[:shifted_key:base_layout_key][;modifiers[:event_type[:text_codepoints]]] u`
//!   decode into [`KeyEvent`]s. We surface press / release / repeat as
//!   distinct [`KeyAction`] variants; we drop the level-3 `shifted_key` /
//!   `base_layout_key` sub-parameters (no encoder integration yet); we
//!   decode the level-5 text codepoints into `KeyEvent.text` whenever
//!   they're present. Hyper / meta modifier bits are collapsed into
//!   `SUPER` / `ALT` respectively — libghostty's `Mods` lacks distinct
//!   hyper / meta bits and a phux-side wrapper is out of scope for v0.
//!   See <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/>.
//! - DCS / OSC / SOS / PM / APC sequences inbound — these come from the
//!   inner program, not from a keyboard, and have no representation as a
//!   `KeyEvent`. They are absorbed and dropped.
//!
//! # libghostty surface check
//!
//! libghostty-vt exposes input *encoders* (`key::Encoder`,
//! `mouse::Encoder`, `focus::Event::encode`, `paste::encode`) but no
//! parser in the reverse direction — there is no `Decoder`, no
//! `parse_bytes`, no public state machine equivalent to xterm's VT input
//! lexer. Confirmed by grepping the `libghostty-vt` crate at the pinned
//! rev (`31d1f70`); only the `terminal::Terminal::vt_write` parser
//! exists, and that is for output bytes from a child process, not input
//! bytes from a host terminal. This module therefore hand-rolls the
//! CSI / SS3 lexer required for inbound input parsing.
//!
//! # Timing ambiguity (bare ESC)
//!
//! Bare ESC and ESC-starting-a-sequence are not distinguishable from the
//! byte stream alone. The classic xterm-style solution is a short idle
//! timeout: if ESC is followed by another byte within ~50ms it starts a
//! sequence, otherwise it stands alone as the Escape key.
//!
//! This module exposes that decision to the driver via [`StdinParser::flush`].
//! The driver arms a [`tokio::time::Sleep`] whenever
//! [`StdinParser::has_pending`] returns `true` and calls `flush()` if the
//! sleep wins the next `select!` race. That keeps timing policy out of
//! the parser (which is sync and timer-free) and inside the loop that
//! already knows about wall time.
//!
//! # Partial sequences across read boundaries
//!
//! A single CSI sequence can straddle two `read()` calls; the parser
//! holds its in-progress state (a private `State` enum + a small
//! parameter buffer) in the [`StdinParser`] struct and resumes on the
//! next [`StdinParser::feed`] call.
