A terminal multiplexer. Your shells live in a background server. Split,
detach, they keep running. The TUI, Cockpit, a script, and an agent all
attach to the same live terminal.

- **same objects** — the pane you are looking at is the pane the harness drives.
- **blocked is a fact** when the harness emits. Screen detection is the fallback.
- **another machine, no account** — `phux --remote me@mini` pairs once; later
  dials are QUIC. There is no phux account in the path.

## Install

```sh
brew trust --tap no-phux/tap
brew install no-phux/tap/phux
```

Or use the verified release installer:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://phux.sh/install | sh
```

Release builds support macOS arm64, Linux x86_64, and Linux arm64. Windows is
not supported. For the native macOS Cockpit:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://phux.sh/install-cockpit | sh
```

Run `phux` to start. Prefix is `Ctrl-A`; `Ctrl-A d` detaches. Other channels
and source builds: [Install](./docs/INSTALL.md).

## Coming from

| You used | |
|---|---|
| **tmux** | Same attach, split, and prefix muscle memory. Every pane is also a real terminal an agent can read and type into. |
| **herdr** | You are already here. The old herdr distro's defaults are phux's defaults. `phux config init --distro starter` for the demo plugins. |
| **screen** | Attach and detach. The rest is in the docs. |

Longer translation: [Coming from tmux, herdr, screen](./docs/coming-from.md).
