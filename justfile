# Fast e2e lane — gates every PR (the `e2e` step in ci.yml). Covers the
# headless agent-surface contract (`run_wait_e2e`), the ADR-0040 agent
# identity record loop (`agent_record_e2e`), plus the wall-clock perf
# gates (`perf_latency`, `perf_colored_output`). These spin a real server +
# PTY, so they are `#[ignore]`d out of the default `just test` pool and run
# serially with `--retries=2`: serial removes the CPU contention that makes
# a fresh attach handshake / snapshot render miss `WIRE_RECV_TIMEOUT`, and
# the retries absorb residual environment-driven flakes (mirroring the
# reconnect override in .config/nextest.toml). Finishes in minutes — fast
# enough to block a PR on.
#
# The BUILD selection is `--workspace` on purpose, even though only four test
# binaries actually run. It must resolve the SAME feature union as the unit
# lane's `cargo nextest run --workspace`, so this lane reuses that build
# instead of producing a second one.
#
# Narrowing the BUILD with `-p`/`--test` is what the old form did, and it cost
# ~87s per CI run. Under the v2/v3 feature resolver a package's dev-dependency
# features only join the unified feature set for packages whose test targets
# are being built, so `-p phux` drops phux-server's dev-deps (tokio/test-util,
# wtransport/dangerous-configuration) and `-p phux-server` drops phux-client's
# tokio/io-std. Each selection therefore re-keys `tokio` into a DIFFERENT unit,
# and every crate downstream of tokio (phux-core, phux-server, phux-client,
# phux, quinn, tokio-util, tokio-rustls, ...) recompiles from scratch.
#
# Test selection is a nextest filterset instead, which is applied AFTER the
# build and so costs nothing. Verified: same 18 tests, 0 crates recompiled.
#
# The filterset names binaries, not files, so renaming/moving one of these test
# files does NOT silently drop it from the PR gate: nextest rejects a
# `binary_id(...)` that matches no binary ("operator didn't match any binary
# IDs") and exits 94. A rename fails this lane loudly, exactly as `--test
# <name>` used to.
#
# Corollary: if ci.yml's unit step ever gains `--all-features`, this recipe
# must gain it too — otherwise the double-compile comes straight back. (Do not
# actually do that; `--all-features` turns on `phux/dhat-heap`, which installs
# dhat as the global allocator and would make the perf gates below measure
# dhat rather than phux.)

# Fast e2e lane (run_wait_e2e + agent_record_e2e + perf gates) — gates every PR.

# Heavy stress/flywheel lane — runs OFF the PR critical path (the `stress`
# GitHub workflow: post-merge on `main` + nightly). Resize/output/lifecycle
# storms that hammer a real server + PTY. They are CPU-starvation-sensitive:
# the server is one current-thread runtime, and on a 2-core runner the
# output-flood-vs-resize-reflow feedback loop balloons a sub-second test
# into minutes (e.g. both_axes_shrink_storm_under_output: ~0.3s on a
# multi-core box, ~13 min on a 2-core runner). That cost is pure CPU
# starvation, not a code defect — so these run where they don't block a PR,
# never as a `just ci` gate. Run locally any time (one binary at a time,
# they pass reliably).

# --- Build observability ---------------------------------------------------
# Three lenses on "why is the build this slow / this big". Honest caveat:
# the dominant COLD-build cost is libghostty-vt's zig blob (a build.rs
# shell-out to zig), which none of these three see — they profile the Rust
# side. For the zig cost, lean on the CPU-keyed CI cache and not rebuilding
# per-worktree. These tools find the *Rust* wins: critical-path crates,
# monomorphization bloat, and binary size.

# Cargo's built-in compile-time report -> target/cargo-timings/. Shows the
# per-crate timeline, the critical path (the longest dependency chain
# gating everything else), and the codegen-vs-frontend split. Pass extra
# args to change profile:
#   just timings                 # debug, --all-targets (dev iteration cost)
#   just timings --release       # the release/LTO timeline
# CAVEAT: a WARM build's timeline is near-empty because cached crates don't
# recompile. For a true cold picture, `cargo clean` first — or use the
# `build-timings` GitHub workflow, which always builds cold.
