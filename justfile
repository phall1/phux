    # WIRE_RECV_TIMEOUT — a fresh attach's snapshot render or even the initial
    # `ClientHandle::attach` handshake times out and the harness panics. These
    # tests are sound in isolation (see the reconnect override in
    # .config/nextest.toml); serializing removes the contention rather than
    # papering over it with retries. The lane is small, so the wall-time cost
    # is a few extra seconds.
