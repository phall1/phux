# @phux/pi

Pi package for selecting, orchestrating, and supervising shared phux terminals
through the external canonical CLI. It provides bounded pane inventory,
spawn/launch with local placement, insert/move/swap topology edits, confirmed
kill/destructive-signal controls, tags, asks, finite event collection, composited
snapshots, and branch-local aliases/groups while keeping
the original selected-target behavior. It does not expose pairing credentials
or emulate missing CLI operations such as paste. Input-authority tools are
blocked upstream: the CLI's connection-scoped lease is released as soon as a
one-shot invocation disconnects, so it cannot provide a durable Pi tool action. Installation, compatibility,
the exact tool and command surface, lifecycle behavior, and safety boundaries
live in the canonical [Pi integration guide](../../docs/consumers/pi.md).

## Development and validation

Install the locked development dependencies from this directory:

```sh
npm ci
```

Run the deterministic gates, which do not call an LLM:

```sh
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run pack:check
npm run smoke:load
```

The real integration harness is opt-in:

```sh
PHUX_PI_REAL_SMOKE=1 npm run smoke:real
```

`pack:check`, `smoke:load`, and `smoke:real` own the package-local artifact and
harness checks. Consumer setup and operational interpretation remain in the
[Pi integration guide](../../docs/consumers/pi.md).
