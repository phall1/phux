# phux-agent-wrap.sh (phux-r82.11) — make a terminal agent self-identify.
#
# Wrap a real agent command so that, the moment it launches inside a
# phux pane, the pane gets a first-class `phux.agent/v1` L3 record
# (ADR-0040) instead of relying on the OSC-title substring heuristic.
# The record carries the agent's name and kind, so the TUI sidebar and
# any fleet view show a declared identity that a plain `claude`/`codex`
# session never announces.
#
# Usage:
#   phux-agent-wrap.sh [--name NAME] [--kind KIND] [--state STATE]
#                      [--target TARGET] -- command [arg...]
#
# Everything after `--` is the real agent argv, run in the foreground so
# its TTY / job-control semantics are untouched. On start the wrapper
# writes the record; on exit (normal, signal, or agent failure) it clears
# it via a trap, so an un-launched pane never shows a stale agent.
#
# Design constraints (see phux CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md):
#   - POSIX sh, no bashisms, no new dependencies.
#   - No shell injection: every value is passed as its own quoted argv
#     element to `phux`; nothing is ever routed through `eval` or `sh -c`.
#   - Best-effort identity: if `phux` is missing or no server is up, the
#     record write fails silently and the agent still launches. Losing the
#     sidebar label must never stop the agent from running.
#
# We deliberately do NOT `exec` the agent: a trap on EXIT cannot fire
# after `exec` replaces this process, and clearing the record on exit is
# the whole point of the trap. Running the agent as a foreground child and
# forwarding its exit status is the only way to guarantee cleanup.
#
# Pane targeting is REQUIRED and resolved exactly once, up front, then
# reused verbatim for both the launch-time `set` and the exit-time `clear`.
# We never let `phux agent set/clear` fall back to whatever pane happens to
# be FOCUSED at CLI-run time: focus moves freely, and the exit-time clear
# fires at an arbitrary later moment, so a focused-pane guess would race —
# in a multi-pane / fleet run the clear would delete a *different*, still-
# running agent's record and leave this pane's record stale. If we cannot
# resolve which pane we are running in, we write nothing at all (best-
# effort no-op) and still launch the agent; a missing sidebar label is
# always safer than corrupting a sibling pane's identity.
#
# The pane target comes from, in order: `--target` / PHUX_AGENT_TARGET, or
# else PHUX_TERMINAL_ID (the pane's wire id, used as the `@N` selector).
# PHUX_TERMINAL_ID is the automatic path: phux exposes it to hook children
# today, and once the server also injects it into spawned pane processes
# (see the README follow-up) a wrapped agent self-targets with no config.
# Until then, a launcher that knows the pane must pass PHUX_AGENT_TARGET /
# --target for the record to be written.
#
# Overrides (env):
#   PHUX_AGENT_PHUX_BIN / PHUX_BIN  path to the `phux` binary (default `phux`)
#   PHUX_AGENT_NAME                 default --name
#   PHUX_AGENT_KIND                 default --kind
#   PHUX_AGENT_STATE                default --state (see note below)
#   PHUX_AGENT_TARGET               default --target (pane selector)
#   PHUX_TERMINAL_ID                pane wire id; used as target `@N` when
#                                   no explicit --target/PHUX_AGENT_TARGET
#
# State note: the wrapper only observes the agent's launch/exit boundary,
# so it does NOT continuously feed a working/blocked lifecycle state. It
# sets name+kind (the high-value, always-honest part) and leaves state
# unset (== unknown) unless you pass --state / PHUX_AGENT_STATE. A live
# state feed would need a separate signal source updating the same record
# — see the README for what that would take.
