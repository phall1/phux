# 02 — run a command and trust its exit code: `run`.
#
# For "run this and tell me whether it worked," reach for `run` instead of
# send-keys + polling. It submits the command, waits for it to finish, and
# reports {command, exit_code, output, duration_ms, truncated} — and the
# `phux` process EXITS WITH THE COMMAND'S OWN CODE, so it composes like a
# shell (`phux run a && phux run b`).
#
# `run` assumes a POSIX shell (sh/bash/zsh): it brackets the command with
# sentinels to read `$?`. It cannot capture a command that REPLACES the
# shell (`exit`, `exec`) — that kills the pane's shell, and with it the
# session. To observe a non-zero code without killing the shell, run it in
# a subshell: `sh -c 'exit 7'`.
#
# Run it:   bash examples/agents/02-run-and-exit-codes.sh
