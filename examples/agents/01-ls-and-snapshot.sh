# 01 — discover and read: `ls` and `snapshot`.
#
# The two side-effect-free reads at the bottom of the agent surface. An
# agent starts a turn by asking "what sessions exist?" (`ls`) and "what's
# on screen?" (`snapshot`). Neither attaches, neither resizes, both are
# safe to poll against a pane a human is using.
#
# Run it:   bash examples/agents/01-ls-and-snapshot.sh
#
# This script stands up its own throwaway server (see lib.sh). A real
# agent skips all that and runs `phux ls` / `phux snapshot` against the
# user's existing one-per-user server, with no --socket.
